\cf0 - some other other bottom-up approaches (with more explicit ties to concepts/categories): \
	- Rips & Conrad\
	- Schwanenflugel et al\
- roots in another kind of \'93bottom-up\'94 approach\'97Piaget\'97which led to extensive empirical work\
	- Piagetian animism\
	- R. Gelman on animate-inanimate distinction (and many many follow-ups, incl. S. Gelman) \
	- Carey on folk psychology/biology, animism/vitalism (and many many follow-ups)\
- folk theories more broadly\
	- especially relevant case: theory of mind\
- importance of development \
- but what recent (21st-century) takes on \'93folk theories\'94 often seem to lack is attention to ontology/conceptual structure: what are the parts, how are they organized, how are they used\

\
CHAPTER 5: DEPLOYMENT\
- change regression lines for continuous development to my actual regression predictions\
- consider adding formal tests of differences in variability? (GD)\
- tweak adapt_delta for r_anim (> 0.99) to decrease divergent transitions\
- add line about social consequences to chapter conclusion\

\f0\b0 \cf0 - robots (refer back to ch04, 7-9yo on robots; ch05, studies 2 and 3 especially)\
- two variants of experimental approach yielded \
	- very similar findings for conceptual units (ch03)\
	- mostly similar findings for organization (ch04), with one exception (BODY vs. MIND)\
	- somewhat different findings for deployment to animates vs. inanimates (ch05) (makes sense!)\

\
APPENDIX A\
- check/add word reference doc file path\
- add/redo scales tables as needed\
- consider adding left vs. right position (study 1c)\
- consider adding first vs. second block (study 4)\
- consider adding beetle vs. robot (studies 1a-1c, study 2, study 4)\
- consider adding scale use across age groups\
- re-number plots\
- re-number tables\
- read through\
\
\
APPENDIX B\
- figure out if/how to store age regression results on git\'85 (2 are too large)\
- reconsider adding: study 3: 7-9yo for 4-6yo?\
- reconsider adding: study 3: contrast coding instead of effect coding (children vs. adults, younger vs. older children)\
- reconsider adding: all studies: comparisons across pairs of units (instead of separate regs for each unit)?\

\
\
APPENDIX D [maybe?]\
- extra questions: \
	- Study 3: made out of metal, turned on/off\
	- Study 4: can you tell me what this is?\
