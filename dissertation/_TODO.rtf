\f0\fs24 \cf0 CHAPTER 1: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS\
- revamp review of cognitive/developmental psychology\

\cf0 - some other other bottom-up approaches (with more explicit ties to concepts/categories): \
	- Rips & Conrad\
	- Schwanenflugel et al\
- roots in another kind of \'93bottom-up\'94 approach\'97Piaget\'97which led to extensive empirical work\
	- Piagetian animism\
	- R. Gelman on animate-inanimate distinction (and many many follow-ups, incl. S. Gelman) \
	- Carey on folk psychology/biology, animism/vitalism (and many many follow-ups)\
- folk theories more broadly\
	- especially relevant case: theory of mind\
- importance of development \
- but what recent (21st-century) takes on \'93folk theories\'94 often seem to lack is attention to ontology/conceptual structure: what are the parts, how are they organized, how are they used\

\
CHAPTER 2: OVERVIEW\
- check whether ch04 & ch05 use imputed data & update accordingly\
\
\
CHAPTER 3: CONCEPTUAL UNITS\
- check table 4.6: should 7-9yo BODY-MIND be non-zero? switched with HEART-MIND?\
\
\
CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATION\
- check whether used imputed data\
- read through\
- spell check\
- remake html, pdf, word\
- update drive\
\
\
CHAPTER 5: DEPLOYMENT\
- check whether used imputed data\
- change regression lines for continuous development to my actual regression predictions\
- change regressions themselves to poisson regressions?? see previous attempts\
- consider adding formal tests of differences in variability? (GD)\
- tweak adapt_delta for r_anim (> 0.99) to decrease divergent transitions\
- add line about social consequences to chapter conclusion\
- CORRECT LABELING OF TABLE 5.8++\
- CHECK REFS TO APPENDIX C\
- read through\
- spell check\
- remake html, pdf, word\
- update drive\

\f1\b \cf0 - [everything]\
- synthesis\
	- MIND stable from early on (ch03)\'85 but may incorporate a little HEART among 4-6y? (ch03)\
	- BODY vs. HEART later-emerging (ch03)\

\
\
APPENDIX A\
- check/add word reference doc file path\
- add/redo scales tables as needed\
- consider adding left vs. right position (study 1c)\
- consider adding first vs. second block (study 4)\
- consider adding beetle vs. robot (studies 1a-1c, study 2, study 4)\
- consider adding scale use across age groups\
- re-number plots\
- re-number tables\
- read through\
\
\
APPENDIX B\
- figure out if/how to store age regression results on git\'85 (2 are too large)\
- reconsider adding: study 3: 7-9yo for 4-6yo?\
- reconsider adding: study 3: contrast coding instead of effect coding (children vs. adults, younger vs. older children)\
- reconsider adding: all studies: comparisons across pairs of units (instead of separate regs for each unit)?\
- read through\

\f1\b \cf0 - [everything]\
- xx appendix c table (formerly 5.7)\
- plot binning age
\f0\b0 \
- using children\'92s own scales\
	- study 2, 79y\
	- study 3, 79y\
	- study 3, 46y 3-factor\
	- study 3, 46y 2-factor\
	- study 4, 45y 3-factor\
	- study 4, 45y 4-factor\
- figure 5.8 by individual character for studies 1d & 3\
- \'93joint dependence\'94 regressions separated by age group & animacy status?\
\
\
APPENDIX D [maybe?]\
- extra questions: \
	- Study 3: made out of metal, turned on/off\
	- Study 4: can you tell me what this is?\
