# Chapter overview

In this chapter, I focus on the second of my three key questions about the development of representations of mental life introduced in Chapter I: _How are these conceptual units organized in relation to each other, and how does this organization change over development?_ As in Chapter III, to address this question I draw on data from all of the current studies (Studies 1-4); for details about the methods of these studies, see Chapter II. The goal of this chapter is to provide "snapshots" of the organization of conceptual units in early childhood, middle childhood, and adulthood.


# General analysis plan: Assessing the hierarchical organization of conceptual units

In analyzing these datasets with an eye toward assessing the hierarchical organization of the "conceptual units" identified in Chapter III, the basic insight is that asymmetries in mental capacity attributions hint at the relationships among these conceptual units (e.g., which conceptual units might be more basic or fundamental, which conceptual units are considered prerequisites for others). In Chapter II, I illustrated this with the following example: If many participants endorse capacities associated with Conceptual Unit A without endorsing capacities associated with Conceptual Unit B, but very few participants endorse capacities do the reverse (endorsing capcaities associated with Conceptual Unit B but not Conceptual Unit A), this provides some evidence that Conceptual Unit A is more basic or fundamental than Conceptual Unit B, or that Conceptual Unit A is a prerequiste for Conceptual Unit B. Here I will translate this general intuition into a specific analysis plan to be applied to each of these datasets in turn. 


# Study 1: An adult endpoint

In our previously published work on these studies (Weisman et al., 2017), we focused mainly on the "conceptual units" analysis presented in Chapter III; we did not attempt to explore the hierarchical relationships among these units. Here I re-analyze these data from this new perspective.

## Special notes on data processing and analysis

As noted in Chapter II, in the original analysis of these datasets responses were recoded to run from -3 to +3 before analyses (Weisman et al., 2017); in this dissertation, I maintain the 0-6 coding for comparability to Studies 2-4.

## Results

### Study 1a

In Study 1a, `r nrow(d1a_ad_wide)` US adults each assessed a single target character on 40 mental capacities. This study employed the "edge case" variant of the general approach, with participants randomly assigned to assess either a beetle or a robot. (See Chapter II and Weisman et al., 2017, for detailed methods.)

### Study 1b

Study 1b was a direct replication of Study 1a: `r nrow(d1b_ad_wide)` US adults each assessed a single target character (either a beetle or a robot) on 40 mental capacities. (See Chapter II and Weisman et al., 2017, for detailed methods.)

### Study 1c

In Study 1c, `r nrow(d1c_ad_wide)/2` US adults each assessed two target characters on 40 mental capacities. Like Studies 1a and 1b, this study employed the "edge case" variant of the general approach; but in this study, all participants assessed both of these target characters side by side (with left-right position counterbalaned across participants). (See Chapter II and Weisman et al., 2017, for detailed methods.)

### Study 1d: Adults, 21 target characters, between-subjects

In Study 1d, `r nrow(d1d_ad_wide)` US adults each assessed a single target character on 40 mental capacities. Unlike Studies 1a-1c, this study employed the "many characters" variant of the general approach, in which participants were randomly assigned to assess one of the following 21 target characters: an adult, a child, an infant, a person in a persistent vegetative state, a fetus, a chimpanzee, an elephant, a dolphin, a bear, a dog, a goat, a mouse, a frog, a blue jay, a fish, a beetle, a microbe, a robot, a computer, a car, or a stapler. (See Chapter II and Weisman et al., 2017, for detailed methods.)

# Study 2: Conceptual change between middle childhood (7-9y) and adulthood

In Study 2, `r nrow(d2_ad_wide)` US adults and `r nrow(d2_79_wide)` US children between the ages of `r summary(d2_79$age)["Min."] %>% round(2)`-`r summary(d2_79$age)["Max."] %>% round(2)` years (median: `r summary(d2_79$age)["Median"] %>% round(2)`y) each assessed a single target character on 40 mental capacities. To make the study appropriate for children in this age range, the wording of some the 40 mental capacities employed in Study 1 was modified to use more age-appropriate vocabulary, and participants responded on a 3-point scale ("no," coded as 0; "kinda," coded as 0.5, "yes," coded as 1). This study employed the "edge case" variant of the general approach, with participants randomly assigned to assess either a beetle or a robot. (See Chapter II for detailed methods.)

# Study 3: Conceptual change over early and middle childhood (4-9y)

In Study 3, `r nrow(d3_ad_wide)` US adults, `r nrow(d3_79_wide)` "older" children (`r summary(d3_79$age)["Min."] %>% round(2)`-`r summary(d3_79$age)["Max."] %>% round(2)` years; median: `r summary(d3_79$age)["Median"] %>% round(2)`y), and `r nrow(d3_46_wide)` "younger" children (`r summary(d3_46$age)["Min."] %>% round(2)`-`r summary(d3_46$age)["Max."] %>% round(2)` years; median: `r summary(d3_46$age)["Median"] %>% round(2)`y) each assessed a single target character on 20 mental capacities. To make the study appropriate for children in this age range, participants assessed a subset of the 40 mental capacities employed in Study 2, chosen to represent the three "conceptual units" revealed by Studies 1-2 (BODY, HEART, and MIND) and to cover a similar range of mental capacities as Studies 1-2. As in Study 2, participants responded on a 3-point scale ("no," coded as 0; "kinda," coded as 0.5, "yes," coded as 1). This study employed the "diverse characters" variant of the general approach, with participants randomly or pseudo-randomly assigned to assess either one of the following 9 characters: an elephant, a goat, a mouse, a bird, a beetle, a teddy bear, a doll, a robot, or a computer. (See Chapter II for detailed methods.)

# Study 4: A focus on early childhood (4-5y)

In Study 4, `r nrow(d4_ad_wide)/2` US adults and `r nrow(d4_46_wide)/2` US children between the ages of `r summary(d4_46$age)["Min."] %>% round(2)`-`r summary(d4_46$age)["Max."] %>% round(2)` years (median: `r summary(d4_46$age)["Median"] %>% round(2)`y) each assessed two target characters on 18 mental capacities. To make the study appropriate for children in this age range, this study employed a new set of 18 mental capacities (some but not all of which were used in Studies 1-3). In addition, participants were presented with a more child-friendly visual representation of the 3-point response scale ("no," coded as 0; "kinda," coded as 0.5, "yes," coded as 1). This study employed the "edge case" variant of the general approach, with participants assessing both a beetle or a robot in sequence (with order counterbalanced across participants). (See Chapter II for detailed methods.)
