abstract = {Social difficulties of autistic individuals have been suggested to be caused by mind blindness, the absence of a theory of mind. Numerous studies have investigated theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder or how autistic individuals represent the mental states of others. Here, we have examined, as an alternative, mind perception, namely how individuals perceive the minds of various animate and inanimate entities. Autistic and non-autistic participants demonstrated evidence of a similar two-dimensional mind perception; agency, capacity for doing (i.e., self-control, memory, plan), and experience, capacity for feeling (i.e., fear, hunger, pain). Some targets (e.g., human infant and dog) were perceived to have low agency but high experience, while others (e.g., robot and God) were perceived to have the reverse pattern. Moreover, in both autistic and non-autistic groups, the attribution of moral blame positively correlated with agency, whereas moral consideration positively correlated with experience. These results offer new evidence of social cognition, particularly conception of mind and morality, in autism. LAY SUMMARY We found that autistic and non-autistic individuals have similar thoughts regarding the minds of various living and nonliving entities. In addition, both groups gave moral consideration or blamed entities for wrongdoing according to their conception of the minds of those entities. Autistic individuals have this mind-based moral sense, which is a pivotal element with a key role in human society.},

Like adults, children older than 9 judged the human-like robot as creepier than the machine-like robot?but younger children did not. Children's perceptions of robots' mental capacities predicted uncanny feelings: children judge robots to be creepy depending on whether they have human-like minds. The uncanny valley is therefore acquired over development and relates to changing conceptions about robot minds. Keywords:},

abstract = {Learning of complex material, such as concepts encountered in science classrooms, can occur under at least three different conditions of prior knowledge. First, a student may have no prior knowledge of the to-be-learned concepts, although they may have some related knowledge. In this case, prior knowledge is missing, and learning consists of adding new knowledge. Second, a student may have some correct prior knowledge about the to-be-learned concepts, but that knowledge is incomplete. In this incomplete knowledge case, learning can be conceived of as gap filling. In both missing and incomplete knowledge conditions, knowledge acquisition is of the enriching kind (Carey, 1991). In a third condition, a student may have acquired ideas, either in school or from everyday experience, that are ?in conflict with? the to-be-learned concepts (Vosniadou, 2004). Knowledge acquisition under this third case is of the conceptual change kind. It is customary to assume in this case that the prior ?in conflict with? knowledge is incorrect or misconceived, and the to-be-learned information is correct, by some normative standard. Thus, learning in this third condition is not adding new knowledge or gap filling incomplete knowledge; rather, learning is changing prior misconceived knowledge to correct knowledge. This chapter focuses on this conceptual change kind of learning.},

@article{Csibra1999c,
abstract = {The proper domain of naive psychological reasoning is human action and human mental states but such reasoning is frequently applied to non-human phenomena as well. The studies reported in this paper test the validity of the currently widespread belief that this tendency is rooted in the fact that naive psychological reasoning is initially restricted to, and triggered by, the perception of self-initiated movement of agents. We report three habituation experiments which examine the necessary conditions under which infants invoke a psychological principle, namely the principle of rational action, to interpret behaviour as goal directed action. Experiment 1 revealed that the principle of rational action already operates at 9 (but not yet at 6) months of age. Experiment 2 demonstrated that perceptual cues indicating agency, such as self-propulsion, are not necessary prerequisites for interpreting behaviour in terms of the principle of rational action. Experiment 3 confirmed that this effect cannot be attributed to generalisation of agentive properties from one object to another. These results suggest that the domain of naive psychology is initially defined only by the applicability of its core principles and its ontology is not restricted to (featurally identified) object kinds such as persons, animates, or agents. We argue that in its initial state naive psychological reasoning is not a cue-based but a principle-based theory. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Questions were selected to probe a wide variety of animate properties. Although the 3- and 4-year-olds made the greatest number of errors, these errors were not distributed differently than the adults' errors and were not skewed toward animism. Instead, animism was strongest in the 5-year-olds. Analysis of the errors indicated that apparent self-movement and physical similarity to animates contributes to animistic bias. 7- and 9-year-old subjects answered in a manner demonstrating no animism, indicating an earlier end to the phenomenon than has been previously suggested.},

Results show that 5-year-olds correctly cluster biological processes and separate them from psychological ones.

@article{Gutheil1998,
abstract = {A current debate within the cognitive development literature addresses how best to characterize conceptual change. Within one proposal, development primarily consists of a series of radical conceptual shifts or restructurings in which the most current understanding is inexplicable within (incommensurate with) prior conceptual structure. Alternatively, development is discussed as more gradual enrichment of multiple existing early explanatory systems, allowing for commensurability over time and change. This paper examines the literature in this debate with specific focus on naive biological understanding, and discusses a series of studies on preschoolers' inductive inferences across biological and non-biological kinds. Children were taught a series of biological properties for a human being (e.g. eating, sleeping etc.), and asked to generalize these properties to both biological (e.g. dogs, worms) and non-biological kinds (e.g. clouds, tables). The results of these studies support the gradual-enrichment proposal. Specifically, 4-year-olds seem to possess limited, but coherent and independent biological theory which may form the basis of mature understanding of biological kinds. These results are discussed in terms of multiple explanatory systems which both preschoolers and adults can employ across development to effectively guide their decisions within a given domain.},

@article{Hatano1994,
abstract = {This article aimed at investigating the nature of young children's naive theory of biology by reviewing a large number of studies conducted in our laboratories. More specifically, we tried to answer the following five critical questions. What components does young children's knowledge system for biological phenomena (or naive biology) have? What functions does it have in children's lives? How is it acquired in ontogenesis? How does its early version change as children grow older? Is it universal across cultures and through history? We propose that young children's biological knowledge system has at least three components, that is, knowledge needed to specify the target objects of biology, ways of inferring attributes or behaviors of biological kinds, and a non-intentional causal explanatory framework, and that these three constitute a form of biology, which is adaptive in children's lives. We also claim that the core of naive biology is acquired based on specific cognitive constraints as well as the general mechanism of personification and the resultant vitalistic causality, but it is differently instantiated and elaborated through activity-based experiences in the surrounding culture.},

@article{Herrmann2010,
abstract = {What is the relation between human and nonhuman animals? As adults, we construe this relation flexibly, depending in part on the situation at hand. From a biological perspective, we acknowledge the status of humans as one species among many (as in Western science), but at the same time may adopt other perspectives, including an anthropocentric perspective in which human characteristics are attributed to nonhuman animals (as in fables and popular media). How do these perspectives develop? The predominant view in developmental cognitive science is that young children universally possess only one markedly anthropocentric vantage point, and must undergo fundamental conceptual change, overturning their initially human-centered framework before they can acquire a distinctly biological framework. Evidence from two experiments challenges this view. By developing a task that allows us to test children as young as 3 years of age, we are able to demonstrate that anthropocentrism is not the first developmental step in children's reasoning about the biological world. Although urban 5-year-olds adopt an anthropocentric perspective, replicating previous reports, 3-year-olds show no hint of anthropocentrism. This suggests a previously unexplored model of development: Anthropocentrismis not an initial step in conceptual development, but is instead an acquired perspective, one that emerges between 3 and 5 years of age in children raised in urban environments.

First, the multidimensional structure of the verbs was studied using a sorting task. The resulting structure was interpreted primarily in terms of three properties: a working property that refers to the operational aspect of information processing (and that is closely related to depth of a cognitive activity), a judgment property, and a creativity property. Second, the notion of intelligence was projected onto the structure, rating the verbs to determine how much intelligence they represented. We discovered that mental activities scoring high on intelligence were related primarily to the working property and to in-depth processing.},

abstract = {Decades of research have documented in school-aged children a persistent difficulty apprehending an overarching biological concept that encompasses animate entities like humans and non-human animals, as well as plants. This has led many researchers to conclude that young children have yet to integrate plants and animate entities into a concept LIVING THING. However, virtually all investigations have used the word "alive" to probe children's understanding, a term that technically describes all living things, but in practice is often aligned with animate entities only. We show that when "alive" is replaced with less ambiguous probes, children readily demonstrate knowledge of an overarching concept linking plants with humans and non-human animals. This work suggests that children have a burgeoning appreciation of this fundamental biological concept, and that the word "alive" paradoxically masks young children's appreciation of the concept to which it is meant to refer.},

In considering children's knowledge about physical, behavioral and mental properties, as well as their life judgments, we found three types of characteristic objects: (a) objects with respect to which they knew the attributes but not whether the object was a living thing; (b) objects whose attributes were not well-known, but with respect to which the children did know whether they were living things, and (c) objects for which they neither knew the attributes nor whether the objects were living things. Knowledge of the definition of living things, of categories of living things, of attributes of particular classes of living things, and of the hierarchical relations among categories all seemed to influence children's judgments of whether objects were alive.},

abstract = {Many preschoolers know that plants and animals share basic biological properties, but this knowledge does not usually lead them to conclude that plants, like animals, are living things. To resolve this seeming paradox, we hypothesized that preschoolers largely base their judgments of life status on a biological property, capacity for teleological action, but that few preschoolers realize that plants possess this capacity. To test the hypothesis, we taught 5-year-olds one of four biological facts and examined the children's subsequent categorization of life status for numerous animals, plants, and artifacts. As predicted, a large majority of 5-year-olds who learned that both plants and animals, but not artifacts, move in goal-directed ways inferred that both plants and animals, but not artifacts, are alive. These children were considerably more likely to draw this inference than peers who learned that the same plants and animals grow or need water and almost as likely to do so as children who were explicitly told that animals and plants are living things and that artifacts are not. Results also indicated that not all biological properties are extended from familiar animals to plants; some biological properties are first attributed to plants and then extended to animals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Psychological experiments have revealed remarkable regularities in the developmental time course of cognition. Infants gen- erally acquire broad categorical distinctions (i.e., plant/animal) before finer ones (i.e., bird/fish), and periods of little change are often punctuated by stage-like transitions. This pattern of progressive differentiation has also been seen in neural network models as they learn from exposure to training data. Our work explains why the networks exhibit these phenomena. We find solutions to the dynamics of error-correcting learning in linear three layer neural networks. These solutions link the statistics of the training set and the dynamics of learning in the network, and characterize formally how learning leads to the emergence of structured representations for arbitrary training environments. We then consider training a neural network on data generated by a hierarchically structured probabilistic gen- erative process. Our results reveal that, for a broad class of such structures, the learning dynamics must exhibit progressive, coarse-to-fine differentiation with stage-like transitions punctuating longer dormant periods.},

The scenarios involved primarily Prospective Memory, List Memory, Recognition Memory, Comprehension, Interference, Planning, Comparison, or Selective Attention. There was a developing tendency to organize mental activities on the degree to which memory was a component of the activity. Several distinctions were also more likely to be made with age: the distinction between recall and recognition, the distinction between the roles of internal and external cues in mediating cognitive activity, and the distinction among the various roles of attentional processes in regulating input from the sensory world. Together, these findings suggest that a constructivist theory of mind develops in later childhood.},

Experiment 1 used thirty-six 8- and thirty-four 10-year-olds, and 27 adults. In Experiment 2, 9- and 11-year-old children were classified according to their cognitive monitoring ability (Markman, 1981). Fifteen cognitive monitoring and 15 nonmonitoring children were used, and 33 adults also participated. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses of each group's ratings indicated that participants distinguished mental verbs according to the certainty aspects and information processing aspects of mental activity. Older children and comprehension monitors placed greater emphasis on the certainty aspects of mental activity than younger children and comprehension nonmonitors. It is concluded that important aspects of a constructivist theory of mind develop during middle childhood. ?? 1996 Ablex Publishing Corporation Norwood, New Jersey.},

abstract = {Cross-cultural commonality and variation in folk theories of knowing were studied by examining the organization of verbs of knowing in German and Japanese adults. German and Japanese adults performed one of two tasks: a similarity judgment task and an attribute rating task. Organizational structure was assessed for the similarity judgment task using multidimensional scaling and additive similarity tree analyses. The attribute rating task was used to describe the characteristics that organized the dimensions and clusters emerging from the scaling solutions. The folk theory of mind displayed was an information processing model with constructive components, although the constructive aspects were more salient for the Germans than for the Japanese.},

@article{Willard2019,
abstract = {Previous research suggests that how people conceive of minds depends on the culture in which they live, both in determining how they interact with other human minds and how they infer the unseen minds of gods. We use exploratory factor analysis to compare how people from different societies with distinct models of human minds and different religious traditions perceive the minds of humans and gods. In two North American samples (American adults, N = 186; Canadian students, N = 202), we replicated a previously found two-factor agency/experience structure for both human and divine minds, but in Fijian samples (Indigenous iTaukei Fijians, N = 77; Fijians of Indian des- cent, N = 214; total N = 679) we found a three-factor structure, with the additional containing items related to social relationships. Further, Fijians' responses revealed a different three-factor structure for human minds and gods' minds. We used these factors as dimensions in the conception of minds to predict (a) expectations about human and divine tendencies towards punishment and reward; and (b) conception of gods as more embodied (an extension of experience) or more able to know people's thoughts (an extension of agency). We found variation in how these factors predict concep- tions of agents across groups, indicating further theory is needed to explain how culturally generated concepts of mind lead to other sorts of social inferences. We conclude that mind perception is shaped by culturally defined social expectations and recommend further work in different cultural contexts to examine the interplay between culture and social cognition.},
