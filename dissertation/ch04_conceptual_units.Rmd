## Identifying conceptual units through exploratory factor analysis (EFA)

My initial goal in conducting these studies was to uncover a set of latent constructs that might plausibly have given rise to the observed correlations among mental capacity attributions in each group of participantsâ€”i.e., to identify a set of "conceptual units" that constitute the core components of conceptual representations of mental life. As such, my primary planned analysis for all studies was an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). I interpreted each of the constructs ("factors") as corresponding to one conceptual unit of a given group of participants' broader representation of mental life.

[XX INTEGRATE and make sure that there's a parallel statement for each study...: Following Study 1d, for our exploratory factor analyses we treated each participant's assessments of each target character as a separate set of observations (as if they came from different participants). This effectively doubled our sample size to `r nrow(d3_ad)` adults and `r nrow(d3_46)` children. (See SOM for separate EFAs of the participants' responses to the first target character that they were assigned to rate vs. the second character.)]


For all EFAs, I used ordinary least squares to find the minimum residual solution, using the "psych" package for R (Revelle, 2018). Here I focus on results using Pearson correlations using pairwise complete observations. (In principle, polychoric correlations are better suited to handle responses on a three-point scale; however, doing these analyses with polychoric correlations instead of Pearson correlations generally appeared to over-fit the data, e.g., suggesting retaining many factors that each accounted for only a very small amount of the shared variance.)

In order to determine how many factors to retain, I examined the results of three factor retention protocols: (1) Parallel Analysis, which compares the observed correlation structure to the correlation structure arising from random datasets of the same size; (2) Minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is one method of optimizing both goodness of fit and parsimony; and (3) A set of factor retention criteria that I have used previous work with adults (Weisman et al., 2017), in which I began with the maximal number of factors according to an analysis of degrees of freedom, and retained factors that met all three of the following criteria: (a) had eigenvalues greater than 1.00, (b) individually accounted for greater than 5% of the shared variance before rotation, and (c) were the "dominant" factor (the factor with the strongest absolute factor loading) for at least 1 mental capacity after rotation. For each study, my interpretation of how best to characterize the dataset (i.e., how many factors I observed) was determined by the degree of consensus among these three protocols and the interpretability of the retained factors under each protocol. 

Here I focus my interpretations on varimax-rotated solutions, which constrain all factors to be orthogonal. (See OSM for solutions using oblique ["oblimin"] rotations, which allow for correlated factors.) [XX RE-ASSESS THIS]



Scraps:
- [FOR TRANSITION FROM STUDY 2 TO STUDY 3]: As demonstrated in Study 1, among adults the "edge case" and "diverse characters" variants of the general approach have yielded very similar pictures of conceptual representations (see also XX CITE Weisman et al., 2017). If this three-part conceptual structure is stable and robust by the age of 7-9 years, it should manifest among 7- to 9-year-old children under the same range of conditions that it does among adults. Thus, in Study 3...
- [FOR TRANSITION FROM STUDY 3 to STUDY 4]: For the final set of questions, I aimed to select six clear examples of physiological sensations (_BODY_), social-emotional abilities (_HEART_), and perceptual-cognitive capacities (_MIND_), according to Studies 1-2 and Weisman et al.'s (2017) original studies with US adults. We reasoned that if these carefully selected examples of _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_ still elicited differences in correlational structures between 4- to 5-year-old children and adults, this would be particularly strong evidence of age-related changes in conceptual structure. The final set of _BODY_ items included _feel hungry_, _get thirsty_, _feel sick_, _feel tired_, _get scared_, and _smell things_. _HEART_ items included _love someone_, _hate someone_, _feel happy_, _get sad_, _feel sorry_, and _get lonely_. _MIND_ items included _see_, _hear_, _think_, _remember things_, _know stuff_, and _figure things out_. We ensured that each category included a variety of phrasings (e.g., "_feel_ hungry" vs. "_get_ thirsty"; "remember _things_" vs. "know _stuff_") and valences when appropriate (e.g., happiness vs. sadness); when possible, we aimed to have these aspects of phrasing vary orthogonally with categories, such that "get" and "feel" appeared roughly equally often among the _BODY_ and _HEART_ items, and "things" appeared equally often among the _BODY_ and _MIND_ items.
