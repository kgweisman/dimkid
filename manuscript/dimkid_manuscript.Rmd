# Introduction

From early in life, attributions of mental states shape our interactions with others and help us navigate our social worlds. We might infer our friends' goals and try to help, or identify when others have forgotten or misunderstood something and correct them; we delight in each other's happiness, seek comfort from each other in times of sadness, and plan our actions to avoid (or to appear to avoid) causing others emotional or physical pain. Beyond our relationships with other humans, attributions of mental capacities to non-humans help us understand the boundaries of our social worlds, from shaping our perspectives on animal rights (_Do cows feel pain, fear, or love?_) to helping us decide how to interact with "artificial intelligences" (_Is it cruel to insult a virtual assistant, like Siri or Alexa?_). From this perspective, representations of mental life are at the core of human social reasoning and experience from very early on. 

At the same time, the concept of "mental life" is complex, encompassing a wide range of experiences and abilities that might be organized in many ways. Capacities for perception, beliefs, desires, goals, thoughts, emotions, physiological sensations, and other mental states have some things in common. For example, in most cases these mental states are consider to be occur privately: Although they guide a person’s facial expressions, words, and actions, none of these mental states is directly observable to anyone else. On the other hand, different kinds of mental states differ in important ways. Some mental states are closely related to specific bodily organs (e.g., people see things with their eyes, and feel hunger in their stomachs), and others less obviously so (where do people experience "belief"?). Some are positively or negatively valenced (e.g., pain feels bad, happiness feels good), and others are more neutral, or vary depending on the circumstance (thought, olfaction). Some mental states involve taking in information about the environment (e.g., seeing, hearing), while others involve storing or updating that information (remembering, learning), or using it to bring about changes in the external world (planning, making choices). Furthermore, people might assume that certain entities in the world have all of the many kinds of experiences and mental capacities that they do themselves (e.g., other humans, perhaps some other mammals), while believing that others have a more limited set. 

In other words, children's representations of mental life are a core component of their social relationships, as well as a fascinating case study of abstract reasoning and its development. How do children conceive of the connections and distinctions among mental states, and how does this conceptual structure shape their understanding of the various humans, animals, technologies, and other "beings" in the world around them?

In the current paper, we set out to derive this conceptual structure empirically, using an exploratory, "bottom-up" approach that surfaces conceptual connections and distinctions from data without reference to a particular pre-specified hypothesis or theory. In a series of studies, we track which capacities tend to "hang together" in children's assessments of the mental lives of animals, technologies, and other entities, using an unsupervised learning technique (exploratory factor analysis) to describe latent conceptual structures that could give rise to observed patterns of correlations among mental capacity attributions at different points in development. 

From our perspective, this approach has two major advantages: It can reveal conceptual structure without requiring participants to articulate it themselves; and the conceptual structures revealed by this approach can, in principle, differ dramatically from the assumptions of a research team. These are especialaly compelling advantages in the domain of conceptual development—in which, by definition, participants struggle to introspect and articulate their reasoning, and findings often conflict with adult intuitions.

To our knowledge, there have been only a few attempts to do something similar in the past. In a series of studies with 8- to 11-year-old children, Fabricius, Schwanenflugel, and colleagues explored one corner of this conceptual space, focusing on how children come distinguish among different "ways of knowing." In their initial study, 8- and 10-year-old children and adults rated the similarity of pairs of activites that involved various kinds of mental states (e.g., "Making a list at home of all the kids in your new class without missing any"; "Trying to find the North Star in the sky on a starry night"; Fabricius, Schwanenflugel, Kyllonen, Barclay, & Denton, 1989). Their results suggested that children gradually come to distinguish between more "perceptual" aspects of knowing (e.g., seeing, hearing) vs. more "conceptual" aspects of knowing (reasoning, understanding) at some point in middle childhood, and later coming to differentiate among ways of knowing according to how much they rely on "memory," with development extending perhaps into adolescence (Fabricius et al., 1989; Schwanenflugel, Fabricius, & Noyes, 1996; Schwanenflugel, Fabricius, Noyes, & Bigler, 1994). More recently, Nook and colleagues have explored another aspect of children's represnetations of mental life, focusing on their developing understanding of emotions by asking participants between the ages of 6 and 25 years to rate the similarity of pairs of emotion words (e.g., "happy", "disgusted"). Echoing Fabricius, Schwanenflugel, and colleages in the domain of "knowing," Nook et al.'s results suggested that younger children first represent emotions along a one-dimensional space of positive vs. negative valence before gradually coming to represent emotions along two dimensions (valence and arousal; Nook, Sasse, Lambert, McLaughlin, & Somerville, 2017). 

Both of these results suggest that children are revising and refining their understanding of cognition and emotion well into middle childhood (and perhaps beyond)—but each of these thought-provoking studies focused on only one aspect of the wide range of experiences and abilities that might be considered part of "mental life." XX JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY WE WANTED TO BE MORE EXPANSIVE: given that children's reasoning about others seems to undergo dramatic changes in so many diverse domains—from reasoning about their beliefs and desires (Wellman, 2017), to reasoning about their biological processes (e.g., Carey, 1985; Medin XX), to reasoning about their social connections and moral status (e.g., XX CITE)-we aimed to take a more expansive approach, including a wider range of mental states in our exploration of children's representations of mental life.

This expansive approach was inpsired by previous work with adults, in which several research teams have developed ways of assessing people's representations of a broader range of mental capacities. Building on pioneering work on the "dimensions of mind perception" (Gray, Gray, & Wegner, 2007), Weisman, Dweck, & Markman (2017) asked adult participants to evaluate a wide variety of mental capacities for a target character (e.g., a robot or a beetle), analyzed patterns of correlation among these mental capacity attributions, and uncovered a three-part conceptual structure that emerged consistently across several studies: Physiological sensations and self-initiated behaviors hung together to form a suite of capacities related to the _BODY_; social-emotional experiences and moral agency formed a suite of capacities related to what they called the _HEART_; and perceptual-cognitive abilities and goal pursuit formed a suite of capacities related to the _MIND_. This _BODY_-_HEART_-_MIND_ framework emerged robustly in multiple studies with US adults, including studies that asked participants to evaluate the mental capacities of one of two "edge cases" in social reasoning (a beetle or a robot) and studies that included a wider variety of target characters, from inert objects, to humans, animals, and various technologies.

The experimental paradigms employed in Gray et al.’s (2007) and Weisman et al.'s (2017) studies are particularly compelling to us as developmental psychologists because of their simplicity. Participants in their studies answered a series of relatively straightforward, concrete questions, which drew on their intuitions about familiar entities in the world: e.g., "How capable is a frog of feeling happy?" (Weisman et al., 2017). It is easy to imagine rewording such questions to be appropriate for even very young children (e.g., "Can a frog feel happy?")—and such questions are likely to be easier, quicker, and more enjoyable for young children than the demanding metacognitive tasks that previous studies have employed (e.g., deciding how similar two sentences are "based on the ways you use your mind in each one"; Fabricius et al., 1989, p. 1281). 

With this in mind, we set out to adapt the bottom-up approach developed in Weisman et al.'s (2017) work with adults to explore conceptual representations of mental life among children. We included a wide variety of mental capacities representing all aspects of mental life—from perception and cognition, to social experiences, emotions and physiological sensations—allowing us to move beyond the more focused explorations of cognition (Fabricius et al., 1989) and emotion (Nook et al., 2017) in particular to a fuller account of children’s conceptual representations of mental life, broadly construed. 

In this paper, we first introduce a child-friendly version of Weisman et al.'s (2017) experimental paradigm, validate it among US adults, and then use this paradigm to conduct an initial exploration of this conceptual structure and mental capacity attributions among US children, focusing on 7- to 9-year-old children (Study 1). Next, we replicate our findings with 7- to 9-year-old children using a briefer experimental paradigm, and use this briefer paradigm to assess the earlier development of these concepts, focusing on 4- to 6-year-old children (Study 2). Finally, we introduce an even simpler version of the paradigm, using more basic vocabulary and a streamlined experimental protocol, designed to validate and refining our understanding of conceptual structure among 4- to 6-year-old children, as well as exploring how younger children's attributions of different aspects of mental life might vary with age (Study 3).

# Overview of Methods and Analyses

Studies 1-3 used very similar experimental paradigms and were designed with the same analyses in mind. Here we provide an overview of the methods and planned analyses for all of these studies; any details that varied across studies are supplied in the "Methods" section of each of the studies. 

## General methods

Following Weisman et al. (2017), these studies were designed with the goal of focusing participants' attention on the similarities, differences, and relationships among various mental capacities.

To this end, each participant was either randomly or pseudo-randomly assigned to assess 1-2 target characters (e.g., a beetle, a robot, a goat, etc.) on a wide range of sensory, perceptual, emotional, social, cognitive, and other mental capacities, ranging in number from 18-40 across studies and presented in either a random or a pseudo-random (counterbalanced) order. Participants were presented with a vivid, full-color photograph of their assigned target in a naturalistic context (e.g., a beetle on a leaf; a robot in an office; a goat in a grassy field), which they had access to throughout the study. 

On each trial, participants were asked a question of the form Do you think a [target] can [do X]? (e.g., "Do you think a beetle can feel happy?"; Studies 1-2) or Can [targets] [do X]? (Study 3) (e.g., "Can beetles feel happy?"). Participants responded on a three-point scale (no, coded as 0; kinda, coded as 0.5; or yes, coded as 1). Although a three-point scale is not optimal for factor analyses, pilot testing suggested that it was critical in allowing children to move fast enough through the study to answer all questions, and maintaining this within-subjects design was our top priority for the planned analyses.

See the Methods section for each study for details of the particular target characters and mental capacities included in each study, as well as the materials and physical setup.

## Exploring conceptual structure through exploratory factor analysis (EFA)

Our primary goal in conducting these studies was to uncover a set of latent constructs that might plausibly have given rise to the observed correlations among mental capacity attributions in each group of participants. As such, our primary planned analysis for all studies was an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Following Weisman et al. (2017), we interpreted each of the constructs ("factors") as corresponding to a fundamental component of mental life, according to this group of participants; by extension, we consider the full set of factors for each sample to represent to the overall "conceptual structure" underlying mental capacity attributions for this group of participants.

For all EFAs, we used ordinary least squares to find the minimum residual solution, using the "psych" package for R (Revelle, 2018). Here we focus on results using Pearson correlations using pairwise complete observations. (See Online Supplementary Materials [OSM] for solutions using polychoric correlations, which are better suited to handle responses on a three-point scale but, to our eyes, tended to over-fit our data by suggesting that we should retain many factors that each accounted for only a small amount of the shared variance.)

In order to determine how many factors to retain, we examined the results of three factor retention protocols: (1) Parallel Analysis, which compares the observed correlation structure to the correlation structure arising from random datasets of the same size; (2) Minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is one method of optimizing both goodness of fit and parsimony; and (3) A set of factor retention criteria that have been used in Weisman et al.'s (2017) previous work, in which they began with the maximal number of factors according to an analysis of degrees of freedom, and retained factors that met all three of the following criteria: (a) had eigenvalues greater than 1.00, (b) individually accounted for greater than 5% of the shared variance before rotation, and (c) were the "dominant" factor (the factor with the strongest absolute factor loading) for at least 1 mental capacity after rotation. For each study, our interpretation of how best to characterize the dataset (i.e., how many factors we observe) was determined by the degree of consensus among these three protocols and the interpretability of the retained factors under each protocol. 

Here we focus our interpretations on varimax-rotated solutions, which constrain all factors to be orthogonal. (See OSM for solutions using oblique ["oblimin"] rotations, which allow for correlated factors.)

## Charting differences in the application of these concepts through regression analyses of factor scores

Having inferred a conceptual structure for a given group of participants via EFA, we then sought to examine attributions of mental capacities to the particular target characters included in each study within this conceptual structure: To what extent did participants attribute each of the fundamental components of mental life revealed by EFA to a given target character, and how did this attributions vary with age (either within an age group or between age groups)? 

To explore this question, for each study we projected children's data into adults' conceptual space and examined "factor scores"—summaries of each participant's attributions of each of factors revealed by EFA. We used the correlation-preserving "ten Berge" method (as implemented in the "psych" package; Revelle, 2018), imputing missing values using the mean (by target character, capacity, and age group). This yielded one factor score for each of (adults') factors, for each participant. We consider these to be summaries of that person's attributions of the corresponding latent construct.

We analyzed these factor scores via mixed effects Bayesian regression analyses using the "brms" package for R (Bürkner, 2017). In all of these analyses, we included the maximal random effect structures given the design for the relevant study. Further details varied by study, depending on the number of target characters included in that study, the number of factors revealed by EFA for the relevant group(s) of participants, and the goals of the analysis (e.g., comparing two age groups vs. examining continuous effects of age within one or more groups of participants).

# Study 1

The goal of Study 1 was to develop a child-friendly version of Weisman et al.'s (2017) study paradigm and conduct an initial exploration of this conceptual structure among children. 

Pilot testing suggested that children as young as 7 years of age found the paradigm easy and enjoyable, and work on the development of lay biology and psychology has suggested that these concepts may continue to develop well into middle childhood (e.g., Carey, 1985; Hatano & Inagaki, 1997; Piaget, 1929; cf. Gelman & Opfer, 2002). Thus, we targeted 7- to 9-year-old children for our first child sample. We also recruited a group of adults to validate our child- friendly paradigm, i.e., to evaluate whether it replicated Weisman et al.'s (2017) original work with adults.
In Weisman et al.'s (2017) original studies, participants evaluated a target character on 40 mental capacities using a seven-point Likert-type scale. Pilot testing suggested two necessary modifications for children: rewording some of the mental capacity items, and using a simpler, three-point response scale (no, kinda, or yes; see "Overview of Methods and Analyses, above"). 

## Method

### Participants

`r nrow(d1_ad_wide) + nrow(d1_79_wide)` people participated in this study.

```{r}
# demographics
d1_ad_gender <- demo_fun(d1_ad, "gender", 2)
d1_ad_ethnicity <- demo_fun(d1_ad, "ethnicity_cat", 2)
d1_ad_english <- demo_fun(d1_ad, "englishNative", 2)
```

Adults (_n_=`r nrow(d1_ad_wide)`) participated via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in July 2016. Adult participants had gained approval for at least 95% of their previous work on MTurk; had MTurk accounts based in the US; and indicated that they were at least 18 years old. Adults were paid \$0.30 for approximately 2-3 minutes of their time (median duration: `r summary(d1_ad$duration)["Median"] %>% round(2)` min). 

According to self report, the adult sample ranged in age from `r summary(d1_ad$age)["Min."]`-`r summary(d1_ad$age)["Max."]` years (median: `r summary(d1_ad$age)["Median"]`y) and was roughly split between women (`r d1_ad_gender$prop[d1_ad_gender$gender=="female"] * 100`%) and men (`r d1_ad_gender$prop[d1_ad_gender$gender=="male"] * 100`%; `r d1_ad_gender$prop[d1_ad_gender$gender=="other_prefNo"] * 100`% of participants identified as some other gender or opted not to disclose). Adults predominantly identified as White (`r d1_ad_ethnicity$prop[d1_ad_ethnicity$ethnicity_cat=="white"] * 100`%; `r d1_ad_ethnicity$prop[d1_ad_ethnicity$ethnicity_cat=="multi"] * 100`% identified as more than one race/ethnicity, and $\leq$ `r data.frame(d1_ad_ethnicity %>% filter(!ethnicity_cat %in% c("white", "multi")))$prop %>% max() * 100`% as any other race/ethnicity). The vast majority of adults reported English being their only native language (`r d1_ad_english$prop[d1_ad_english$englishNative == "yes_only"] * 100`%; an additional `r d1_ad_english$prop[d1_ad_english$englishNative == "yes_multiple"] * 100`% indicated that English was one of multiple native languages for them.)

```{r}
# demographics
d1_79_gender <- demo_fun(d1_79, "gender", 2)
d1_79_ethnicity <- demo_fun(d1_79, "ethnicity", 2)
d1_79_bilingual <- demo_fun(d1_79, "bilingual", 2)
```

Children (_n_=`r nrow(d1_79_wide)`) participated at one of several San Francisco Bay Area museums or at their younger sibling's preschool between July-December 2016. The study took most children under 10 minutes to complete (median duration: `r summary(d1_79$duration)["Median"] %>% round(2)` min). An additional 12 children participated but were excluded for being outside the target age range (_n_=7), being of unknown age (_n_=4), or being shown a target character other than a beetle or a robot (_n_=1). Children received a small thank-you gift (e.g., a sticker) for their participation. 

Children ranged in age from `r summary(d1_79$age)["Min."] %>% round(2)`-`r summary(d1_79$age)["Max."] %>% round(2)` years (median: `r summary(d1_79$age)["Median"] %>% round(2)`y). According to parental report, the child sample included slightly more girls (`r d1_79_gender$prop[d1_79_gender$gender=="f"] * 100`%) than boys (`r d1_79_gender$prop[d1_79_gender$gender=="m"] * 100`%; `r d1_79_gender$prop[d1_79_gender$gender=="MISSING"] * 100`% of children's gender was non-binary or unknown). Parents predominantly identified their children as White (`r d1_79_ethnicity$prop[d1_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="white"] * 100`%), multiracial (`r d1_79_ethnicity$prop[d1_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="multi"] * 100`%), East Asian (`r d1_79_ethnicity$prop[d1_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="east asian"] * 100`%), or South Asian (`r d1_79_ethnicity$prop[d1_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="south or southeast asian"] * 100`%; $\leq$ `r data.frame(d1_79_ethnicity %>% filter(!ethnicity %in% c("white", "multi", "east asian", "south or southeast asian", "MISSING")))$prop %>% max() * 100`% of children were identified as any other race/ethnicity, and `r d1_79_ethnicity$prop[d1_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="MISSING"] * 100`% of children's race/ethnicity was unknown). Roughly half of parents (`r d1_79_bilingual$prop[d1_79_bilingual$bilingual=="yes"] * 100`%) reported that their child was bilingual (though, anecdotally, parents' interpretations of "bilingual" ranged from taking classes at school to speaking a langauge at home).

### Materials and procedure

Following Weisman et al. (2017, Studies 1-3), participants were randomly assigned to assess the mental capacities of one of two "edge cases" in social reasoning: a beetle (_n_=`r d1_ad %>% filter(character == "beetle") %>% distinct(subid) %>% nrow()` adults, _n_=`r d1_79 %>% filter(character == "beetle") %>% distinct(subid) %>% nrow()` children) or a robot (_n_=`r d1_ad %>% filter(character == "robot") %>% distinct(subid) %>% nrow()` adults, _n_=`r d1_79 %>% filter(character == "robot") %>% distinct(subid) %>% nrow()` children). Because beetles are animals and robots are artifacts, this pair provides insight into the role of biological life in attributions of mental life—an issue of particular interest from a developmental perspective, given the long history of work on the development of the animate-inanimate distinction and its relation to folk psychology. Most critically for our bottom-up approach to uncovering conceptual structure, the "mental lives" of these entities are controversial: People differ in their assessments of the mental capacities of beetles and robots. This allowed us to address the following question: When participants disagree about the mental capacities of some entity, which capacities "go together"?

Instructions to participants focused on the idea that we wanted to know what participants thought "[beetles/robots] can do and can not do." Participants rated the target character on 40 mental capacities, presented in a random order for each participant. On each trial, participants responded _no_, _kinda_, or _yes_ to the question "Do you think a [beetle/robot] can...?" The three response options were visible throughout the experiment.

The 40 mental capacities were designed to be as close as possible to those in Weisman et al.'s (2017) original studies, while being comprehensible to children in early elementary school. This set of items included physiological sensations related to biological needs (e.g., _get hungry_); emotional experiences (e.g., _feel happy_); perceptual abilities (e.g., _hear sounds_); cognitive abilities (e.g., _remember things_); capacities related to autonomy or agency (e.g., _decide what to do_); social abilities (e.g., _feel guilty_); and several additional items (e.g., _be aware of itself_). Each of these a priori categories included at least five items of varying valence, complexity, and phrasing. (See Figure 1 for the full list of mental capacities included in Study 1.)

We also prepared a short definition for each item, so as to be consistent in our responses to participants (particularly children) if they asked for clarification (see SOM). Children were encouraged at the beginning of the study to ask questions if they did not know what a word meant, in which case they given these definitions; adults were told that they could access these definitions by hovering over the text on the computer screen. Pilot testing suggested that seven items required clarification for most children, so these items were always accompanied by their definitions from the beginning of the trial (for both adults and children), as follows: _have a personality, like when someone is shy and somebody else is silly_; _have beliefs, like when you think something is true_; _feel pleasure, like when something feels really good_; _have desires, like when you really want something_; _have self- control, like when you stop yourself from doing something you shouldn't do_; _have goals, like when you're trying hard to do something or make something happen_; and _feel sick, like when you feel like you might throw up_. 

Adults completed the study by clicking through a website at their own pace, with one trial presented on each page and no ability to go backwards. Children completed the study on an experimenter's laptop computer. The experimenter read the instructions and the first several trials out loud, requesting verbal responses from the child and selected his or her response for her; after several trials, the experimenter gave the child the option to continue independently (reading the questions and selecting their answers themselves) if they desired. Roughly half of participants completed the remainder of the task independently.

### Data processing

We dropped trials with response times that were faster than a preset criterion of 250ms (_n_=3 child trials, _n_=97 adult trials) and retained participants regardless of skipped trials (_n_=55 child trials, _n_=1 adult trial). Overall, only 1% of adult trials and 1% of child trials were missing data; in these cases, we imputed missing values using the median by target character, capacity, and age group.

## Results

### Conceptual structure: Adults

```{r}
# implement 3 factor retention protocols
nfact_par_d1_ad <- fa.parallel(d1_ad_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, 
                               fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$nfact
nfact_bic_d1_ad <- vss(d1_ad_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, rotate = chosen_rot, 
                       fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$vss.stats$BIC %>% which.min()
nfact_wdm_d1_ad <- reten_fun(d1_ad_wide_i, rot_type = chosen_rot)

cat("Parallel analysis: ", nfact_par_d1_ad,
    "\nMinimizing BIC: ", nfact_bic_d1_ad,
    "\nWeisman et al.: ", nfact_wdm_d1_ad)
```

```{r}
efa_4_d1_ad <- fa_fun(d1_ad_wide_i, 4)

```

Two of our three methods for determining how many factors to retain (minimizing BIC and Weisman et al.'s factor retention criteria) suggested retaining three factors. (Parallel analysis suggested retaining four factors. Three of these factors were very similar to the three factors reported below, and the fourth factor was dominant for a handful of sensory and perceptual capacities, including `r top_n_domCap(efa_4_d1_ad, 4, "F4", "pos")`; see SOM.)

```{r}
efa_3_d1_ad <- fa_fun(d1_ad_wide_i, 3)
efa_3_plot_d1_ad <- heatmap_fun(efa_3_d1_ad, 
                                factor_names = c("HEART", "BODY", "MIND")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Adults (n=", nrow(d1_ad_wide_i), ")"))
```

After rotation, the first factor corresponded primarily to capacities for self- and other-relevant emotions—a suite of capacities that we (following Weisman et al.) will refer to as _HEART_. It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d1_ad, 4, "F1", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d1_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution.

The second factor corresponded primarily to physiological sensations related to biological needs—a suite of capacities that we (following Weisman et al.) will refer to as _BODY_. It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d1_ad, 4, "F2", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d1_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The third factor corresponded primarily to perceptual-cognitive abilities to detect and use information about the environment—a suite of capacities that we (following Weisman et al.) will refer to as _MIND_. It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d1_ad, 4, "F3", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d1_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution.  

See Figure 1 for all factor loadings. (Note that for the sake of consistency across studies and comparison with Weisman et al.'s work, we have plotted these factors in the same order for all studies: _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_.)

In sum, as Weisman et al.'s original studies, a three-factor structure emerged from adults' mental capacity attributions, characterized by a distinction between body, heart, and mind. This suggests that our child-friendly paradigm was valid: Using reworded items and a three-point response scale elicited the same intuitive ontology of mental life, among adults, that has been revealed by more complex, "adult-friendly" experimental paradigms. 

### Conceptual structure: Children (7-9y)

```{r}
# implement 3 factor retention protocols
nfact_par_d1_79 <- fa.parallel(d1_79_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, 
                               fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$nfact
nfact_bic_d1_79 <- vss(d1_79_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, rotate = chosen_rot, 
                       fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$vss.stats$BIC %>% which.min()
nfact_wdm_d1_79 <- reten_fun(d1_79_wide_i, rot_type = chosen_rot)

cat("Parallel analysis: ", nfact_par_d1_79,
    "\nMinimizing BIC: ", nfact_bic_d1_79,
    "\nWeisman et al.: ", nfact_wdm_d1_79)
```

Our three methods for determining how many factors to retain all suggested retaining three factors.

```{r}
efa_3_d1_79 <- fa_fun(d1_79_wide_i, 3)

efa_3_plot_d1_79 <- heatmap_fun(efa_3_d1_79, 
                                factor_names = c("HEART", "BODY", "MIND")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Children 7-9y (n=", nrow(d1_79_wide_i), ")")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

```{r}
cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79 <- fa.congruence(efa_3_d1_79$loadings,
                                     efa_3_d1_ad$loadings)
```

After rotation, the first factor corresponded primarily to social-emotional abilities. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F1", "F1"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F1", "F2"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F1", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d1_79, 4, "F1", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d1_79$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The second factor corresponded primarily to physiological sensations. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F2", "F2"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F2", "F1"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F2", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d1_79, 4, "F2", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d1_79$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The third factor corresponded primarily to perceptual-cognitive abilities. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _MIND_ factor (cosine similarity with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F3", "F3"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F3", "F1"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d1_ad_79["F3", "F2"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d1_79, 4, "F3", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d1_79$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. (See Figure 1 for all factor loadings.)

In sum, like adults, children's mental capacity attributions were dominated by a three-way distinction between physiological, social-emotional, and perceptual-cognitive abilities—i.e., body, heart, and mind.

ggdraw(fig01_with_caption)
```

### Attributions of mental life

The factor analyses of correlations among mental capacity attributions just described shed light on one aspect of children's concepts of mental life: its ontological structure. The design of our study also allows us to look at a second aspect of conceptual development in this domain: children's application of this concept, i.e., which mental capacities they tend to attribute or not to attribute to the different target characters. How might children's attributions of capacities related to _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_ vary across middle childhood (7-9y), and how do they compare to the mental capacity attributions of adults?

#### Children vs. adults

  rownames_to_column("subid_char") %>%
  full_join(d1_79_wide_i %>%
              rownames_to_column("subid_char")) %>%
  column_to_rownames("subid_char")
```

```{r}
efa_3_d1_79_project_scores <- predict(object = efa_3_d1_ad,
                                      data = d1_79_wide_i,
                                      old.data = d1_ad_wide_i) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("subid_char") %>%
  mutate(subid = gsub("_.*$", "", subid_char),
         character = gsub("^.*_", "", subid_char)) %>%
  gather(factor, score, -c(subid, character, subid_char)) %>%
  mutate(factor_name = recode_factor(factor,
                                     "F2" = "BODY",
                                     "F1" = "HEART",
                                     "F3" = "MIND")) %>%
  arrange(subid_char)
```

To compare children's mental capacity attributions to those of adults, we projected children's responses into the factor space defined by adults (standardized in terms of adults' responses), and examined factor scores by age group (using the correlation-preserving method articulated by ten Berge, Krijnen, Wansbeek, & Shapiro, 1999, as implemented in the "psych" package for R, Revelle, 2018). This yielded three scores for each participant, corresponding, in principle, to holistic judgments of the social-emotional, physiological, and perceptual-cognitive abilities of the target character the participant evaluated. (Note that each of these three scores takes into account factor loadings for all 40 mental capacities, as shown in Figure 1.) 

This allowed us to examine the effects of age group (adult, child), character (beetle, robot), and factor (_BODY_, _HEART_, _MIND_) on these scores via mixed effects Bayesian regression. See Table 1 for the results of a maximal model and Figure 4 for scores by age group, age (for children), factor, and character.

Collapsing across factors, factor scores suggest that adults generally attributed fewer mental capacities to the robot than the beetle (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_all, "characterR_GM")`). However, this appears to be entirely due to the huge discrepancy between characters in the _BODY_ domain; the difference between characters was reduced to nothing in the _HEART_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_all, "factor_nameH_GM:characterR_GM")`), and reversed in the perceptual-cognitive domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_all, "factor_nameM_GM:characterR_GM")`). 

Meanwhile, children tended to attribute more mental capacities, collapsing across characters, than did adults (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_all, "age_groupCH79_AD")`) - but this was driven primarily by the social-emotional domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_all, "factor_nameH_GM:age_groupCH79_AD")`), and was reversed in the perceptual-cognitive domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_all, "factor_nameM_GM:age_groupCH79_AD")`).

Error bars are bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Note that the range of the y-axis differs across panels.", 62), x = 0, hjust = 0)
ggdraw(fig02_with_caption)
```

A visual inspection of Figure 2 clarifies these findings. Attributions in the _BODY_ and _MIND_ domains were rather similar for children and adults: Both children and adults marked a clear difference between the robot and the beetle in the physiological sensations of the _BODY_ (top row), in line with the animate–inanimate distinction; and both age groups credited the robot with slightly greater perceptual-cognitive skills (_MIND_) than the beetle (bottom row). In contrast, in the _HEART_ domain (middle row) both the beetle and the robot received rather low scores among adults, but very high scores among children.

The raw data further supporst these observations; see Figure 3 for raw counts of _no_, _kinda_, and _yes_ responses for all items, grouped by factor, character, and age group. For example, consider hunger (the first capacity under _BODY_): Across age groups, nearly every participant said that a beetle could get hungry, while few participants (with the exception of some children) said that a robot could. Likewise, for mathematical computations (the last capacity under _MIND_), virtually no participants said that a beetle was capable of doing math, while the vast majority of both adults and children said that a robot was. But for social-emotional abilities, like feeling proud, feeling joy, and feeling sad (the first three capacities under _HEART_), far more children than adults endorsed these capacities for beetles and robots. (See SOM for an analysis, parallel to the regression analyses here, of the proportion of the top-loading mental capacities for each factor that were endorsed by participants of different ages.)

#### Age differences within the child sample

Of course, our sample of "children" included participants as young as 7 years and up to nearly 10 years of age. How did attributions vary across this age range? 

```{r}
d1_ch_age <- d1_79 %>% distinct(subid, age)
```

```{r}
# efa_3_scores_r_d1_79 <- brm(score ~ factor_name * age * character
#                             + (1|subid),
#                             data = efa_3_scores_d1_all %>%
#                               filter(age_group == "children79", !is.na(age)) %>%
#                               mutate(age = scale(age, scale = F)),
#                             seed = 12345,
#                             cores = 4,
#                             control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99))
# saveRDS(efa_3_scores_r_d1_79, file = "./brms_models/efa_3_scores_r_d1_79.rds")

efa_3_scores_r_d1_79 <- readRDS("./brms_models/efa_3_scores_r_d1_79.rds")
# summary(efa_3_scores_r_d1_79)
```

To explore age-related differences continuously within the child sample, we conducted an additional regression analysis on children's factor scores alone, including interactions with exact age in years (centered at the mean: `r format(round(mean(d1_ch_age$age, na.rm = T), 2), nsmall = 2)`y) rather than age group. In line with the age group analysis described in the previous section, this confirmed that, relative to the grand mean, attributions of _HEART_ decreased with age (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_79, "factor_nameH_GM:age")`) and attributions of _MIND_ increased with age (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d1_79, "factor_nameM_GM:age")`). (See Table 2 for the full results of this model.)

```{r, include = T, results = "asis"}

Indeed, visual inspection of Figure 4 suggests that, across all three domains (_BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_), children's mental capacity attributions to beetles and robots appeared to become more adult-like with age—but while the oldest children were indistinguishable from adults in the _BODY_ and _MIND_ domains, even the oldest children appear to have attributed more social-emotional abilities to these entities than most adults did.

```

Taken together, these analyses converge to suggest only minor differences between children and adults in their attributions of _BODY_ and _MIND_ to beetles and robots—but a major difference in _HEART_: Relative to adults, children tended to credit both beetles and robots with much greater social-emotional abilities. 

## Discussion

Study 1 shed light on two distinct aspects of the development of children's concpetual representations of mental life: continuity in the underlying conceptual _structure_ and variabilty in the _application_ of these concepts. 

### Conceptual structure is adultlike at 7-9y

On the one hand, exploratory factor analyses suggested that by midddle childhood (7-9y), the conceptual structure underlying US children's attributions of mental life is very similar to that of US adults, anchored by suites of mental capacities related to _BODY_ (physiological sensations), _HEART_ (social-emotional abilities), and _MIND_ (perceptual-cognitive abilities). We note that, in principle, a number of additional or alternative latent factors could have emerged from the factor analysis of children's responses. For example, children might have distinguished primarily between internal experience and external action (Gray et al., 2007), or they might have demonstrated finer-grained groupings of mental capacities based on phrasing, rote knowledge, etc. Instead, the latent conceptual structure underlying children's responses appears to be very similar to that of adults, both in this study and in Weisman et al.'s (2017) previous work. In other words, any dramatic developmental changes to this conceptual structure likely occur prior to the age of 7 years.

### Attributions of _HEART_ undergo dramatic development extending well into middle childhood

On the other hand, analyses of children's attributions within this shared conceptual structure suggested that their application of this concept—in particular, their attributions of the social-emotional abilities of the _HEART_—may be undergoing substantial refinement through middle childhood. The specificity of this age difference—which emerged dramatically in one domain (_HEART_), but not others (_BODY_, _MIND_)—suggests that this is unlikely to be due either to a general tendency toward "mentalizing" these characters (or a simple "yes" bias). But its extension to both beetles and robots raises many questions. With regard to robots, children growing up in the 21st century might be converging on a new understanding of technological "beings" as inanimate objects with some degree of social-emotional life (see Kahn, Gary, & Shen, 2013)—but this kind of historical conceptual change would not predict the high rates of social-emotional attributions to beetles that we observed. Our findings are perhaps more consistent with a general openness to untraditional social partners that extends into middle childhood (but not adulthood)—or with a difference in construals of what it means to feel proud, happy, guilty, etc. To what kinds of entities would children of this age deny social-emotional abilities, and how do they draw this line? How would younger children's attributions of _HEART_ (as well as _BODY_ and _MIND_) compare?

# Study 2

The goals of Study 2 were threefold. 

First, we aimed to extend our findings with 7- to 9-year-old children in Study 1, by expanding the list of the target characters to include not only the two "edge cases" from Study 1 (a beetle and a robot), but a also a wider range of animate beings (a bird, a goat, and an elephant) and inanimate objects (a computer, a teddy bear, and a doll). In contrast to Study 1, where we tracked which mental capacities "hang together" when participants reasoned about controversial "edge cases" in social reasoning, Study 2 allowed us to track which mental capacities "hang together" when target characters are perceived to vary in their mental capacity profiles. In Weisman et al.'s original studies, this approach yielded a highly similar conceptual structure to the "edge case" approach (Weisman et al., 2017; Study 4). We reasoned that if this three-part conceptual structure is stable and robust by the age of 7-9 years, it should manifest among 7- to 9-year-old children under the same range of conditions that it does among adults. 

Our second goal was to assess the earlier development of conceptual structure in a group of younger children. We targeted 4- to 6-year-old children for our younger age group because this has been identified as a period of dramatic development in several relevant domains. Many studies have documented shifts in children's abilities to take others' perspectives, represent false beliefs, and integrate representations of intentions and outcomes in evaluating moral responsibility (for reveiws, see Flavell, 1999; Wellman, 2015). The preschool years have also been the focus of a rich tradition of work on lay biology and the animate-inanimate distinction extending back nearly a century (e.g., Carey, 1985; R. Gelman, Spelke, & Meck, 1983; Medin, Waxman, Woodring, & Washinawatok, 2010; Piaget, 1929; for a review, see S. Gelman & Opfer, 2002). All of these accounts make the case that becoming a sophisticated reasoner—and particularly a sophisticated social reasoner—requires substantial refinement of one's representations of others' experiences, beliefs, desires, and needs. Might these refinements include changes to the structure of children's concepts of mental life? 

Our third goal was to examine age-related changes in which mental capacities tend to be attributed to which target characters. In summarizing the results of Study 1, we discussed mental capacity attributions as the "application" of concepts of mental life, in contrast to the conceptual "structure" revealed by exploratory factor analysis. By expanding the range of target characters included in the study, Study 2 provides an opportunity to explore changes in how children apply their developing concepts of mental life to a variety of animate beings and inanimate objects.

## Method

### Participants

`r nrow(d2_ad_wide) + nrow(d2_79_wide) + nrow(d2_46_wide)` people participated in this study, including a group of adults, a group of "older" children (7-9y), and a group of "younger" children (4-6y).

```{r}
# demographics
d2_ad_gender <- demo_fun(d2_ad, "gender", 2)
d2_ad_ethnicity <- demo_fun(d2_ad, "ethnicity_cat", 2)
```

Adults (_n_=`r nrow(d2_ad_wide)`) participated via MTurk in September 2018. Adult participants had gained approval for at least 95% of their previous work on MTurk; had MTurk accounts based in the US; and indicated that they were at least 18 years old. Adults were paid \$0.45 for approximately 2-4 minutes of their time (median duration: `r summary(d2_ad$duration)["Median"] %>% round(2)` min). An additional 22 adults participated but were excluded for failing to respond sensibly to an open-ended question about what they had been asked to do in the study (e.g., copying and pasting text from the question, writing "good study," or describing a different study, e.g., "I wrote an essay about nature"; _n_=11) or for failing to pass one or more attention checks (e.g., "Please select no"; _n_=11). According to self report, the final adult sample ranged in age from `r summary(d2_ad$age)["Min."]`-`r summary(d2_ad$age)["Max."]` years (median: `r summary(d2_ad$age)["Median"]`y) and included slightly more men (`r round(d2_ad_gender$prop[d2_ad_gender$gender=="m"], 2) * 100`%) than women (`r round(d2_ad_gender$prop[d2_ad_gender$gender=="f"], 2) * 100`%). Adults predominantly identified as White (`r d2_ad_ethnicity$prop[d2_ad_ethnicity$ethnicity_cat=="white"] * 100`%; `r d2_ad_ethnicity$prop[d2_ad_ethnicity$ethnicity_cat=="multi"] * 100`% identified as more than one race/ethnicity, and $\leq$ `r data.frame(d2_ad_ethnicity %>% filter(!ethnicity_cat %in% c("white", "multi")))$prop %>% max() * 100`% as any other race/ethnicity).

```{r}
# demographics
d2_79_gender <- demo_fun(d2_79, "gender", 2)
d2_79_ethnicity <- demo_fun(d2_79, "ethnicity", 2)
d2_46_gender <- demo_fun(d2_46, "gender", 2)
d2_46_ethnicity <- demo_fun(d2_46, "ethnicity", 2)
```

We recruited two groups of children: "older" children (7-9y) and "younger" children (4-6y). Our planned sample size was 120 per age group, but we also retained a handful of extra participants who completed the study on the final day of data collection for each group.

The group that we will refer to as "older children" (_n_=`r nrow(d2_79_wide)`) ranged in age from `r summary(d2_79$age)["Min."] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)`-`r summary(d2_79$age)["Max."] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)` years (median: `r summary(d2_79$age)["Median"] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)`y), and participated at one of several San Francisco Bay Area museums or at their younger sibling's preschool between July-December 2016. The study took most older children under `r quantile(d2_79$duration, .75, na.rm = T) %>% as.numeric() %>% ceiling()` minutes to complete (median duration: `r summary(d2_79$duration)["Median"] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)` min). According to parental report, the sample of older children included slightly more boys (`r d2_79_gender$prop[d2_79_gender$gender=="m"] * 100`%) than girls (`r d2_79_gender$prop[d2_79_gender$gender=="f"] * 100`%); `r d2_79_gender$prop[d2_79_gender$gender=="MISSING"] * 100`% of children's gender was non-binary or unknown). Parents predominantly identified their children as White (`r d2_79_ethnicity$prop[d2_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="white"] * 100`%), South Asian (`r d2_79_ethnicity$prop[d2_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="south or southeast asian"] * 100`%), multiracial (`r d2_79_ethnicity$prop[d2_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="multi"] * 100`%), or East Asian (`r d2_79_ethnicity$prop[d2_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="east asian"] * 100`%); $\leq$ `r data.frame(d2_79_ethnicity %>% filter(!ethnicity %in% c("white", "multi", "east asian", "south or southeast asian", "MISSING")))$prop %>% max() * 100`% of children were identified as any other race/ethnicity, and `r d2_79_ethnicity$prop[d2_79_ethnicity$ethnicity=="MISSING"] * 100`% of children's parents declined to provide information on their race/ethnicity). 

"Younger children" (_n_=`r nrow(d2_46_wide)`) ranged in age from `r summary(d2_46$age)["Min."] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)`-`r summary(d2_46$age)["Max."] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)` years (median: `r summary(d2_46$age)["Median"] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)`y), and participated either at a university-affiliated preschool or at a Bay Area museum between January-June 2017. The study took most younger children under `r quantile(d2_46$duration, .75, na.rm = T) %>% as.numeric() %>% ceiling()` minutes to complete (median duration: `r summary(d2_46$duration)["Median"] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)` min). According to parental report and school records, the sample of younger children included roughly the same number of girls (`r d2_46_gender$prop[d2_46_gender$gender=="m"] * 100`%) and boys (`r d2_46_gender$prop[d2_46_gender$gender=="f"] * 100`%). Children were predominantly identified as multiracial (`r d2_46_ethnicity$prop[d2_46_ethnicity$ethnicity=="multi"] * 100`%) or White (`r d2_46_ethnicity$prop[d2_46_ethnicity$ethnicity=="white"] * 100`%; $\leq$ `r data.frame(d2_46_ethnicity %>% filter(!ethnicity %in% c("white", "multi", "MISSING")))$prop %>% max() * 100`% of children were identified as any other race/ethnicity, and `r d2_46_ethnicity$prop[d2_46_ethnicity$ethnicity=="MISSING"] * 100`% of children's parents declined to provide information on their race/ethnicity).

An additional 7 children participated but were excluded for being outside the target age ranges. At museums (but not at the preschool), children received a small thank-you gift (e.g., a sticker) for their participation. 

### Materials and procedure

Pilot testing suggested that working with younger children would require making a briefer experimental paradigm with fewer than the 40 questions included in Study 1; limiting the list to 20 questions seemed to allow children as young as 4 years of age to complete the study easily and without getting bored or frustrated, while still including enough items to enable us to proceed with our exploratory "dimensionality reduction" approach to uncovering conceptual structure.

```{r}
d2_ad_char <- demo_fun(d2_ad, "character")
d2_79_char <- demo_fun(d2_79, "character")
d2_46_char <- demo_fun(d2_46, "character")
d2_all_char <- d2_ad_char %>% mutate(age_group = "adults") %>%
  full_join(d2_79_char %>% mutate(age_group = "children79")) %>%
  full_join(d2_46_char %>% mutate(age_group = "children46"))
```

Participants were assigned to evaluate one of the following target characters: an elephant, a goat, a mouse, a bird, a beetle, a teddy bear, a doll, a robot, or a computer (_n_ per characater: `r min(d2_ad_char$n)`-`r max(d2_ad_char$n)` adults, `r min(d2_79_char$n)`-`r max(d2_79_char$n)` older children, and `r min(d2_46_char$n)`-`r max(d2_46_char$n)` younger children; see Figure 6 for exact counts).

Participants were assigned to target characters randomly, with two exceptions: (1) The doll and teddy bear conditions were run last for older children (but included in the initial randomization scheme for adults and younger children); and (2) Toward the end of data collection with children, children were assigned to conditions that had the fewest participants. (This was not possible with adults, which is why the number of adults per condition was more variable than the number of children per condition.) As in Study 1, a vivid, high-resolution photo of the target character in a naturalistic context was visible for the duration of the study. 

Instructions and procedure were identical to Study 1, with two exceptions: (1) Participants rated the target character on 20 (rather than 40) mental capacities; and (2) For younger children, the experimenter read all questions out loud and children responded verbally. 

The 20 mental capacities were a subset of the 40 items used in Study 1, chosen to include physiological sensations, emotional experiences, perceptual abilities, cognitive skills, capacities related to autonomy or agency, and social abilities; and to include some of the strongest-loading items for each of the three factors uncovered among adults in Study 1 (see Figure 1). As in Study 1, each mental capacity was associated with a short, preset definition. Both older and younger children were encouraged at the beginning of the study to ask questions if they did not know what a word meant, in which case they were given these definitions. (Adults did not have access to these definitions.)

After completing the 20 questions about mental capacities, for a subset of participants we also asked two additional questions: "Is a [target] made out of metal?" and "Can a [target] be turned on and off?" These questions were always asked last, and were not intended to be included in any of our primary analyses. See SOM for an analysis of responses to these questions.

### Data processing

We planned to drop trials with response times that were faster than a preset criterion of 250ms, but there were none among children, and we failed to record response times among adults. As in Study 1, we retained participants regardless of skipped trials. Overall, none of adults or older children's trials, and only `r round(sum(is.na(d2_46_wide))/sum(!is.na(d2_46_wide))*100, 2)`% of younger children's trials (_n_=`r sum(is.na(d2_46_wide))`) were missing data.

For our exploratory factor analyses, we looked at each group of partipants (adults, older children, and younger children) separately, because EFA is a group-level analysis of the consensual conceptual structure and is not designed to model continuous participant-level variables like exact age. Our goal with these analyses was to examine discrete "snapshots" of this conceptual structure at two points in this continuous developmental trajectory.

## Results

### Conceptual structure: Adults

```{r}
# implement 3 factor retention protocols
nfact_par_d2_ad <- fa.parallel(d2_ad_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, 
                               fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$nfact
nfact_bic_d2_ad <- vss(d2_ad_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, rotate = chosen_rot, 
                       fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$vss.stats$BIC %>% which.min()
nfact_wdm_d2_ad <- reten_fun(d2_ad_wide_i, rot_type = chosen_rot)

cat("Parallel analysis: ", nfact_par_d2_ad,
    "\nMinimizing BIC: ", nfact_bic_d2_ad,
    "\nWeisman et al.: ", nfact_wdm_d2_ad)
```

```{r}
efa_4_d2_ad <- fa_fun(d2_ad_wide_i, 4)
```

As in Study 1, two or our three methods for determining how many factors to retain (in this case, parallel analysis and Weisman et al.'s factor retention criteria) suggested retaining three factors. (Minimizing BIC suggested retaining four factors, but the fourth factor was the dominant factor for only `r top_n_domCap(efa_4_d2_ad, 20, "F4", "pos") %>% length()` mental capacity: `r top_n_domCap(efa_4_d2_ad, 20, "F4", "pos")`; see SOM.)

```{r}
efa_3_d2_ad <- fa_fun(d2_ad_wide_i, 3)
efa_3_plot_d2_ad <- heatmap_fun(efa_3_d2_ad, 
                                factor_names = c("BODY", "HEART", "MIND")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Adults (n=", nrow(d2_ad_wide_i), ")")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

As expected, the conceptual structure revealed by this analysis among adults was characterized by a three-way distinction between _BODY_ (first factor, `r round(efa_3_d2_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution), _HEART_ (second factor, `r round(efa_3_d2_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of shared variance), and _MIND_ (third factor, `r round(efa_3_d2_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of shared variance). See Figure 5, Panel D.

This suggests that our modified child-friendly paradigm was valid: Using a shorter list of items and a wider range of target characters elicited the same intuitive ontology of mental life, among US adults, that was revealed in Study 1 and in Weisman et al.'s (2017) previous work. 

### Conceptual structure: Older children (7-9y)

```{r}
# implement 3 factor retention protocols
nfact_par_d2_79 <- fa.parallel(d2_79_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, 
                               fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$nfact
nfact_bic_d2_79 <- vss(d2_79_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, rotate = chosen_rot, 
                       fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$vss.stats$BIC %>% which.min()
nfact_wdm_d2_79 <- reten_fun(d2_79_wide_i, rot_type = chosen_rot)

cat("Parallel analysis: ", nfact_par_d2_79,
    "\nMinimizing BIC: ", nfact_bic_d2_79,
    "\nWeisman et al.: ", nfact_wdm_d2_79)
```

```{r}
efa_3_d2_79 <- fa_fun(d2_79_wide_i, 3)

efa_3_plot_d2_79 <- heatmap_fun(efa_3_d2_79, 
                                factor_names = c("BODY", "HEART", "MIND")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Older children (7-9y, n=", nrow(d2_79_wide_i), ")")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

```{r}
cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79 <- fa.congruence(efa_3_d2_79$loadings,
                                     efa_3_d2_ad$loadings)
```

Our three methods for determining how many factors to retain all suggested retaining three factors. As in Study 1, the conceptual structure revealed by this analysis among 7- to 9-year-old children was very similar to that of adults, again characterized by a three-way distinction between _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_.

After rotation, the first factor corresponded primarily to physiological sensations. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F1", "F1"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F1", "F2"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F1", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_79, 4, "F1", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d2_79$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The second factor corresponded primarily to social-emotional abilities. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F2", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F2", "F1"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F2", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_79, 4, "F2", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d2_79$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The third factor corresponded primarily to perceptual-cognitive abilities. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _MIND_ factor (cosine similarity with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F3", "F3"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F3", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_79["F3", "F1"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_79, 4, "F3", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d2_79$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. (See Figure 5, Panel C, for all factor loadings.)

We consider this to be a close conceptual replication of our Study 1 findings, suggesting that by the age of 7-9 years, this three-part conceptual structure is stable and robust to a range of experimental conditions.

### Conceptual structure: Younger children (4-6y)

```{r}
# implement 3 factor retention protocols
nfact_par_d2_46 <- fa.parallel(d2_46_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, 
                               fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$nfact
nfact_bic_d2_46 <- vss(d2_46_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, rotate = chosen_rot, 
                       fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$vss.stats$BIC %>% which.min()
nfact_wdm_d2_46 <- reten_fun(d2_46_wide_i, rot_type = chosen_rot)

cat("Parallel analysis: ", nfact_par_d2_46,
    "\nMinimizing BIC: ", nfact_bic_d2_46,
    "\nWeisman et al.: ", nfact_wdm_d2_46)
```

```{r}
efa_1_d2_46 <- fa_fun(d2_46_wide_i, 1)
```

Our three methods for determining how many factors to retain each suggested retaining different numbers of factors: Weisman et al.'s factor retention criteria suggested retaining `r nfact_wdm_d2_46` factors, parallel analysis suggested retaining `r nfact_par_d2_46` factors, and minimizing BIC suggested a null, `r nfact_bic_d2_46`-factor solution. Here we present both the two- and three-factor solutions. (See SOM for factor loadings on the one "factor" in the null, one-factor solution, which yielded particularly strong loadings for social-emotional experiences and physiological sensations, such as `r top_n_domCap(efa_1_d2_46, 4, "F1")`.)

#### Three-factor solution

```{r}
efa_3_d2_46 <- fa_fun(d2_46_wide_i, 3)

efa_3_plot_d2_46 <- heatmap_fun(efa_3_d2_46,
                                factor_names = c("BODY*", "MIND", "HEART*")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Younger children (4-6y, n=", nrow(d2_46_wide_i), "): 3-factor solution")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

```{r}
cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46 <- fa.congruence(efa_3_d2_46$loadings,
                                     efa_3_d2_ad$loadings)
```

In the rotated three-factor solution suggested by Weisman et al.'s retention criteria, the first factor corresponded primarily to physiological sensations, as well as some positive emotions. An analysis of factor congruence indicated that this factor was most similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F1", "F1"]`), but was also quite similar to adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F1", "F2"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F1", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_46, 4, "F1", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d2_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The second factor corresponded primarily to perceptual-cognitive abilities, as well as one complex negative emotion (_feel guilty_). An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _MIND_ factor (cosine similarity with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F2", "F3"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F2", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F2", "F1"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_46, 4, "F2", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d2_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The third factor corresponded primarily to social-emotional abilities, with particularly strong loadings for positive emotions. An analysis of factor congruence indicated that this factor was most similar to adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F3", "F2"]`), but also quite similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F3", "F1"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F3", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_46, 4, "F3", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d2_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. (See Figure 5, Panel B, for all factor loadings.)

We would describe this conceptual structure as reminiscent of the _BODY_-_HEART_-_MIND_ structure found among older children and adults, but not as fully "adult-like." In particular, in this structure, the physiological sensations associated with the _BODY_ among older children and adults are not as clearly differentiated from the emotional experiences associated with the _HEART_. Indeed, it it not clear that _BODY_ vs. _HEART_ is the most salient distinction among the first and third factors in this solution: A cleaner description of these factors might be negatively-valenced experiences vs. positively-valenced experiences. 

#### Two-factor solution

```{r}
efa_2_d2_46 <- fa_fun(d2_46_wide_i, 2)

efa_2_plot_d2_46 <- heatmap_fun(efa_2_d2_46,
                                factor_names = c("BODY-HEART", "MIND")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Younger children (4-6y, n=", nrow(d2_46_wide_i), "): 2-factor solution"))
```

```{r}
cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46 <- fa.congruence(efa_2_d2_46$loadings,
                                     efa_3_d2_ad$loadings)
```

In the rotated two-factor solution suggested by parallel analysis, the first factor encompassed both physiological sensations and emotions. An analysis of factor congruence indicated that this factor was most similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F1", "F1"]`), but was also quite similar to adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F1", "F2"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F1", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_2_d2_46, 4, "F1", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_2_d2_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated two-factor solution. 

The second factor corresponded primarily to perceptual-cognitive abilities, as well as one complex negative emotion (_feel guilty_). An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _MIND_ factor (cosine similarity with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F2", "F3"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F2", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F2", "F1"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_2_d2_46, 4, "F2", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_2_d2_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. (See Figure 5, Panel A, for all factor loadings.)

In relation to the _BODY_-_HEART-_MIND_ structure found among older children and adults, we would describe this two-factor structure as being anchored by a contrast between the cognitive capacities of the _MIND_ vs. a set of warmer, more visercal experiences that constitute a more integrated representation of _BODY-HEART_.

```{r, include = T, fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 1}
fig05_plots <- plot_grid(efa_2_plot_d2_46, efa_3_plot_d2_46, 
                         efa_3_plot_d2_79, efa_3_plot_d2_ad,
                         labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))

```

### Attributions of mental life

In Study 1, we saw that even children as old as 7-9y—whose conceptual structure seemed to be quite similar to that of adults'—nonetheless differed from adults in their _application_ of this concept, attributing far more of the social-emotional abilities related to the _HEART_ to both beetles and robots. How do children's mental capacity attributions compare to adults for the larger set of target characters included in Study 2—and what does this aspect of conceptual developmental look like earlier in development (4-6y)?

Following Study 1, we projected all of children's responses into the factor space defined by adults (standardized in terms of adults' responses), and examined factor scores by age group (again, using the method articulated by ten Berge et al., 1999). As in Study 1, this yielded three scores for each participant, corresponding, in principle, to holistic judgments of the social-emotional, physiological, and perceptual-cognitive abilities of the target character the participant evaluated. (Note that each of these three scores takes into account adult factor loadings for all 20 mental capacities, as shown in Figure 5, Panel D.) 
This allowed us to examine the effects of age group (younger children, older children, adults), factor (_BODY_, _HEART_, _MIND_), and target character on these scores via mixed effects Bayesian regression. As in Study 1, factor was effect-coded, and age group was dummy-coded with adults as the baseline, to assess whether children in each age group were "adult-like" in their assessments. To examine differences in mental capacity attributions to different target characters, we coded each character as either "animate" (elephant, goat, mouse, bird, beetle) or "inanimate" (computer, robot, doll, teddy bear), and included animacy status (effect-coded) as a fixed effect in our regression model. We included intercepts and slopes for individual characters as random effets in our model, along with intercepts for individual participants.[^1]

[^1]: We notes that the complexities of the design of Study 2 could lend themselves to more complex models than what we have presented here, and we encourage readers to examine a model including multiple comparisons between sets of characters (e.g., mammals vs. non-mammals; technologies vs. toys) presented in the SOM. All of the effects described below also hold true in this more complex model.

The results of this model can be found in Table 3.

By definition, adults' factor scores did not differ across factors (HEART vs. grand mean: `r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameH_GM")`; MIND vs. grand mean: `r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM")`). As we would expect, adults attributed more mental capacities (collapsing across factors) to animates than inanimates (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "anim_inananim_GM")`)—a difference that was diminished in the _HEART_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameH_GM:anim_inananim_GM")`), but not substantially diminished in the _MIND_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM:anim_inananim_GM")`).

As a group, 7- to 9-year-old children's mental capacity attributions did not differ from adults, collapsing collapsing across factors and characters (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "age_groupCH79_AD")`)—but this masks several important differences between older children and adults. As in Study 1, older children's scores were characterized by a relative over-attribution of abilities in the _HEART_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameH_GM:age_groupCH79_AD")`), and a relative under-attribution of abilities in the _MIND_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM:age_groupCH79_AD")`). Collapsing across factors, older children made less of a distinction between animate an inanimate target characters, relative to adults (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "anim_inananim_GM:age_groupCH79_AD")`). This relative under-differentiation of animate and inanimate characters was particularly pronounced in the _MIND_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM:anim_inananim_GM:age_groupCH79_AD")`).

How did younger children compare to adults? As a group, 4- to 6-year-old children's mental capacity attributions did not differ from adults, collapsing collapsing across factors and characters (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "age_groupCH46_AD")`)—but again, this masks a variety of developmental differences that generally parallel the differences between older children and adults just described. Much like older children, younger children's scores were characterized by a relative over-attribution of abilities in the _HEART_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameH_GM:age_groupCH46_AD")`) and a relative under-attribution of abilities in the _MIND_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM:age_groupCH46_AD")`), and they differentiated less between animate an inanimate target characters than did adults (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "anim_inananim_GM:age_groupCH46_AD")`). This relative under-differentiation of animate and inanimate characters was particularly pronounced in the _MIND_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM:anim_inananim_GM:age_groupCH46_AD")`), and less pronounced in the _HEART_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_anim_r, "factor_nameH_GM:anim_inananim_GM:age_groupCH46_AD")`).

Each participant recieved a factor score for each factor (BODY, HEART, and MIND, as defined by an exploratory factor analysis of adults' responses). We treated these scores as summaries of that participants' mental capacity attributions in these domains; a score of 0 corresponds to the mean for that factor among adults. We present two ways of looking at these data: collapsing characters into animates (beetle, bird, mouse, goat, elephant) vs. inanimates (computer, robot, doll, teddy bear; Panel A); and examining each character individually (Panel B). Error bars are bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Note that the range of the y-axis differs across rows.", 210), x = 0, hjust = 0)
ggdraw(fig06_with_caption)
```

A visual inspection of Figure 6 further clarifies these findings. 

In the _BODY_ domain, a distinction between animate and inanimate target characters was clearly present in all age groups, though slightly attenuated among 4- to 6-year-old children (see Figure 6, Panel A, top row). A closer look at factor scores for individual characters (Panel B, top row) suggests that younger children diverged from adults primarily in their attributions to the "edge cases" that were the focus of Study 1: the robot (to which they over-attributed the physiological sensations related to the _BODY_), and the beetle (to which they under-attributed such _BODY_ capacities). Older children's _BODY_ attributions were generally indistinguishable from adults' for almost all target characters. (The only possible exception is the bird—but, in our view, it appears that this was driven by _adults_ slightly _under_-attributing _BODY_ capacities to this character.)

In the _HEART_ domain, the distinction between animate and inanimate target characters was subtler across all age groups, and the degree of distinction did not vary dramatically with age (see Figure 6, Panel A, middle row). Instead, children generally over-attributed _HEART_ to _both_ animates and inanimates; these over-attributions declined between 4-6y and 7-9y of age, but did not reach adult-like levels even among older children. This is consistent with Study 1, in which 7- to 9-year-old children over-attributed _HEART_ to both the beetle and the robot, relative to adults. In this study, older children again attributed more _HEART_ capacities to the beetle and the robot, but also to the mouse and the goat (see Panel B, middle row). Relative to other animates, adults attributed particularly few _HEART_ capacities to the mouse and the goat—perhaps because of their respecive statuses as vermin and food animals in this cultural context.

Finally, in the _MIND_ domain, neither group of children made a robust distinction between animates and inamates—but adults clearly did (see Figure 6, Panel A, bottom row). Instead, children generally under-attributed _MIND_ to _both_ animates and inanimates. These under-attributions became less dramatic between 4-6y and 7-9y of age, and by 7-9y children's _MIND_ attributions to inanimates were adult-like. But even at 7-9y, children did not attributed as many _MIND_ capacities to animates as did adults; between 7-9y and adulthood, _MIND_ attributions increased for all of the animate characters, and particularly dramatically for the bird, the mouse, and the elephant (see Figure 6, Panel B, bottom row).

The raw data further supporst these observations; see Figure 7 for raw counts of _no_, _kinda_, and _yes_ responses for all items, grouped by factor, animacy status (Panels A-C) or character (Panels D-F), and age group. For example, consider pain (the first capacity under _BODY_): Across age groups, most participants said that an elephant could feel pain, with the proportion of "yes" responses increasing across age groups; meanwhile, few participants said that a computer could feel pain, with the proportion of "yes" responses decreasing across age groups. More dramatic changes are evident in the _HEART_ and _MIND_ factors, with attributions of _HEART_ generally decreasing across age groups (especially to inanimate target characters - e.g., the computer, the robot), and attributions of _MIND_ generally increasing across age groups (especially to animate target characters - e.g., the mouse, the goat, the elephant). (See SOM for an analysis, parallel to the regression analyses here, of the proportion of the top-loading mental capacities for each factor that were endorsed by participants of different ages.)

#### Age differences within the child samples

As in Study 1, we were interested not only in differences across age groups, but also across the—even wider—age range within our child samples. In Study 2, this included children as young as 4 years up to nearly 10 years of age. This allowed us to look at age-related differences in mental capacity attributions across a wide period from early to middle childhood.

```{r}
# d2_49_anim_r <- brm(score ~ factor_name * anim_inan * age +
#                       (1 | subid) +
#                       (1 + factor_name | character),
#                     data = d2_anim %>%
#                       filter(age_group != "adults", !is.na(age)) %>%
#                       mutate(age = scale(age, scale = F)),
#                     control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99),
#                     cores = 4)
# saveRDS(d2_49_anim_r, file = "./brms_models/d2_49_anim_r.rds")

d2_49_anim_r <- readRDS("./brms_models/d2_49_anim_r.rds")
# summary(d2_49_anim_r)
```

```{r}
d2_ch_age <- full_join(d2_46 %>% distinct(subid, age),
                       d2_79 %>% distinct(subid, age))
```

To explore age-related differences continuously within the child samples, we conducted an additional regression analysis on children's factor scores alone, including interactions with exact age in years (centered at the mean: `r format(round(mean(d2_ch_age$age, na.rm = T), 2), nsmall = 2)`y) rather than age group. See Table 4 for the full results of this model, and Figure 8 for a visualization of changes in children's factor scores across the age range.

This analysis confirmed that, relative to the grand mean, attributions of _HEART_ decreased with age (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_49_anim_r, "factor_nameH_GM:age")`) and attributions of _MIND_ increased with age (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_49_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM:age")`). These findings are both in line with the age group analysis described in the previous section, suggesting that the observed group differences correspond to gradual developmental differences as children's responses become increasingly adult-like. 

If children were also becoming increasingly adult-like in their distinctions between animate and inanimate target characters, based on the results of our age group analysis (previous section) we would also expect the overall animate-inanimate distinction to increase with age, driven primarily by increases in the _BODY_ and especially _MIND_ domains (see Figure 6, Panel A). Instead, collapsing across factors, the general distinction between animates and inanimates did _not_ differ with age (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_49_anim_r, "anim_inananim_GM:age")`); _decreased_ in the _HEART_ domain, relative to the grand mean (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_49_anim_r, "factor_nameH_GM:anim_inananim_GM:age")`); and did not change substantially in the _MIND_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(d2_49_anim_r, "factor_nameM_GM:anim_inananim_GM:age")`). 

We note that participants who assessed the robot seemed to become particularly un-adult-like at older ages (see Figure 8, Panel B, in blue). Excluding these participants yields a more coherent picture of increasing adult-like-ness with increasing age (Figure 8, Panel A, in turquoise). This did not appear to be the case when excluding any of the other inanimate target characters. We elaborate on children's conceptualizations of the mental lives of robots in particular in the General Discussion (see also Weisman, under review). (See also SOM for an analysis of how excluding any individual target character, or any individual mental capacity, affects the conceptual structures revealed by factor analysis for each of the three age groups in Study 2.)

## Discussion

We had three goals in Study 2: (1) To test whether the adult-like conceptual structure revealed among 7- to 9-year-old children in Study 1 would hold under the range of conditions that elicit this structure among US adults in Weisman et al.'s (2017) previous work; (2) To explore conceptual structure at an earlier point in development (4-6y); and (3) To explore age-related differences in the _application_ of concepts of mental life by examining which mental capacities participants of different ages tended to attribute to the nine target characters included in this study.

### Conceptual structure is robust among 7- to 9-year-old children

Regarding our first goal, Study 2 suggests that the three-part conceptual structure—anchored by _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_—is reliable and robust among 7- to 9-year-old US children. As in Weisman et al.'s (2017) original work with adults, the capacities that "hang together" in older children's reasoning when target characaters are perceived to vary in mental capacity profiles appear to be highly similiar to those that "hang together" when participants disagree about the mental lives of controversial "edge cases" in social reasoning (Study 1).

### Conceptual structure changes between 4-6y and 7-9y

Regarding our second goal, Study 2 suggests that this conceptual structure undergoes substantial changes between early and middle childhood. Like older children and adults, 4- to 6-year-old children’s responses were characterized by strong correlations among a suite of perceptual and cognitive capacities that we have labeled _MIND_. This highlights one aspect of conceptual structure that seems to be relatively stable from early childhood onward. 

However, in contrast to the clear distinction between physiological abilities and social-emotional abilities that characterized mental capacity attributions among older children and adults, younger children’s responses suggest that they perceived physiological and social-emotional abilities to be more closely integrated and the line between them to be more blurred.

```{r}
efa_2_d2_46_highload <- loadings_fun(efa_2_d2_46, "long") %>% 
  filter(loading >= 0.60) %>%
  arrange(factor, desc(loading)) %>%
  group_by(capacity) %>%
  mutate(adult_factor = case_when(
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F1", "pos")) == T ~ "BODY",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F2", "pos")) == T ~ "HEART",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F3", "pos")) == T ~ "MIND",
    TRUE ~ "no dominant factor")) %>%
  ungroup()
```

One indication of this blurring comes from the two-factor solution suggested by parallel analysis, in which a single _BODY-HEART_ factor emerged and was highly congruent with both the _BODY_ (cosine similarity: `r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F1", "F1"]`) and _HEART_ (`r cong_efa_2_d2_ad_46["F1", "F2"]`) factors of adults. Among the mental capacities that loaded strongly ($\geq$ 0.60) on this factor were both physiological sensations (e.g., `r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_2_d2_46_highload$capacity[efa_2_d2_46_highload$adult_factor=="BODY" & efa_2_d2_46_highload$factor == "F1" & efa_2_d2_46_highload$capacity != "get angry"])`) and social-emotional experiences (`r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_2_d2_46_highload$capacity[efa_2_d2_46_highload$adult_factor=="HEART" & efa_2_d2_46_highload$factor == "F1"])`), suggesting that younger children perceived physiological and social-emotional abilities to "go together" to a considerable degree.

```{r}
efa_3_d2_46_domCap <- loadings_fun(efa_3_d2_46, "long") %>% 
  arrange(desc(loading)) %>%
  group_by(capacity) %>%
  top_n(1, loading) %>%
  mutate(adult_factor = case_when(
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F1", "pos")) == T ~ "BODY",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F2", "pos")) == T ~ "HEART",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F3", "pos")) == T ~ "MIND",
    TRUE ~ "no dominant factor")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(factor, desc(loading))

efa_3_d2_46_lowload <- loadings_fun(efa_3_d2_46, "long") %>% 
  filter(loading <= 0.40) %>%
  arrange(factor, desc(loading)) %>%
  group_by(factor, capacity) %>%
  mutate(adult_factor = case_when(
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F1", "pos")) == T ~ "BODY",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F2", "pos")) == T ~ "HEART",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_ad, 20, "F3", "pos")) == T ~ "MIND",
    TRUE ~ "no dominant factor")) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Even in the 3-factor solution suggested by Weisman et al.'s (2017) original factor retention protocol, the distinction between physiological and social-emotional abilities was somewhat blurred. While the first factor, which we've labeled _BODY\*_, was highly congruent with adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F1", "F1"]`), it was also the dominant factor for two social-emotional items (`r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_3_d2_46_domCap$capacity[efa_3_d2_46_domCap$factor == "F1" & efa_3_d2_46_domCap$adult_factor == "HEART"])`). And while the third factor, which we've labeled _HEART\*_, was highly congruent with adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity: `r cong_efa_3_d2_ad_46["F3", "F2"]`), there were several social-emotional items that failed to load strongly on it (loadings $\leq$ 0.40: `r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_3_d2_46_lowload$capacity[efa_3_d2_46_lowload$factor == "F3" & efa_3_d2_46_lowload$adult_factor == "HEART"])`). Stepping back, it is not clear that "physiological vs. social-emotional" is the best way to characterize the differences between these two factors. In fact, given that the strongest-loading items for _BODY\*_ were negatively valenced (`r gsub("and ", "", top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_46, 3, "F1", "abs"))`) while the strongest-loading items for _HEART\*_ were positively valenced (`r gsub("and ", "", top_n_domCap(efa_3_d2_46, 3, "F3", "abs"))`), it seems plausible that the more salient distinction among this age group may have been positive vs. negative valence, rather than _BODY_ vs. _HEART_. The salience on negative vs. positive experiences among younger children is consistent with recent work on the development of emotion concepts, which suggests that emotion representations are dominanted by a single dimension of valence in early to middle childhood, before unfolding into a two-dimensional space characterized by valence and arousal over the course of later childhood and adolesence (Nook et al., 2017).

Finally, the very fact that different approaches to factor retention yielded different results is further evidence that, although we observed some evidence for a nascent distinction between _BODY_ and _HEART_ among 4- to 6-year-old children, this distinction was not as robust as it appeared to be among older children or adults.

### Developmental changes in attributions of all three components of mental life—_BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_—begin by early childhood and continue into middle childhood

Regarding our third goal, Study 2 revealed a wide variety of age-related changes in children's mental capacity attributions, in all three aspects of mental life as conceptualized by adults.  

In Study 1, we observed that 7- to 9-year-old children's attributions of _HEART_ were particularly un-adult-like: As a group, these children attributed much more in the way of social-emotional abilities to both a beetle and a robot than did adults (according to an analysis of factor scores, with children's data projected into adults' conceptual space). In the Study 1 sample, this difference appeared to decline with age between 7-9y, but never quite reached adult-like levels.

```{r}
# r_d2_49_robot_HEART <- brm(score ~ age,
#                            data = full_join(
#                              efa_3_d2_46_project_scores %>%
#                                filter(character == "robot", 
#                                       factor_name == "HEART") %>%
#                                left_join(d2_46 %>% distinct(subid, age)),
#                              efa_3_d2_79_project_scores %>% 
#                                filter(character == "robot",
#                                       factor_name == "HEART") %>%
#                                left_join(d2_79 %>% distinct(subid, age))) %>%
#                              mutate(age = scale(age, scale = F)) %>%
#                              distinct())
# saveRDS(r_d2_49_robot_HEART, "./brms_models/r_d2_49_robot_HEART.rds")

r_d2_49_robot_HEART <- readRDS("./brms_models/r_d2_49_robot_HEART.rds")
# summary(r_d2_49_robot_HEART)
```

In line with this, Study 2 also revealed age-related differences in attributions of _HEART_: Relative to adults, children across the age range tended to over-attribute social-emotional abilities—not only to the robot and the beetle, but to most of the target characters included in this study (see Figure 6). Again, this tendency generally declined with age, with one exception: If anything, children's attributions of _HEART_ to robots appeared to _increase_ between 4-9y of age in this sample (though not substantially, according to a Bayesian regression: `r write_b_95CI_fun(r_d2_49_robot_HEART, "age")`). The subset of 4- to 9-year-old children who assessed the robot (_n_=`r d2_all_char %>% filter(age_group != "adults", character == "robot") %>% summarise(N = sum(n)) %>% as.numeric()`) in Study 2 constituted a much smaller sample than the `r d1_79 %>% distinct(subid, character) %>% filter(character == "robot") %>% nrow()` 7- to 9-year-old children who assessed the robot in Study 1, so the "true" developmental trajectory of _HEART_ attributions to robots remains unclear. (We return to this question armed with more data from 4- to 6-year-old children in Study 3, and make further remarks on children's attributions to robots more generally in the General Discussion.) Setting aside robots for the moment, our general take-aways from Studies 1-2 are that chidlren's attributions of social-emotional abilities (what we call _HEART_) appear to undergo especially dramatic developmental changes over the course of early and middle childhood. These changes seem to be generally monotonic in nature; that is, we see gradual decreases in social-emotional attributions across the board from 4-9y, and no strong evidence for non-linearities. Finally, these developmental changes appears to extend well into middle childhood, and perhaps beyond.

Beyond the general decline in _HEART_ attributions with age, we also observed age-related differences in attributions of both _BODY_ and especially _MIND_, which were revealed most clearly thorugh an examination of children's mental capacity attributions to animate beings (beetle, bird, mouse, goat, elephant) vs. inanimate objects (computer, robot, doll, teddy bear). 

In the _BODY_ domain, a distinction between animate and inanimate target characters was clearly present even among the youngest children, but increased gradually across the 4-7y age range (appearing to reach a degree of separation comparable to adults sometime between 7-9y; see Figure 8). As described above, younger children diverged from adults primarily in their attributions of _BODY_ to the "edge cases" that were the focus of Study 1: the robot and the beetle. Looking back at Study 1, we observe a similar, though subtler, pattern even among 7- to 9-year-old children when the set of target characters was limited to these edge cases. Taken together, these results suggest that while by the age of 4-6y children are relatively far along in their mastery of which entities in the world are subject to the physiological sensations of the _BODY_, they continue to refine their application of this concept throughout early (and perhaps into middle) childhood.

Finally, in the _MIND_ domain, we observed unanticipated age-related differences that were perhaps even more striking than the differences in the _HEART_ domain described earlier. Relative to adults, children across the age range tended to under-attribute perceptual and cognitive abilities, both to inanimate target characters and especially to animate target characters. Generally speaking, children's under-attributions of _MIND_ became less pronounced with age—but even the oldest children attributed less in the way of perceptual-cognitive abilities to such target characters as the elephant, the mouse, and the bird than did adults (see Figure 6).

#### Interim summary

In Studies 1-2 we documented differences in the conceptual structure underlying mental capacity attributions between early childhood (4-6y) and middle childhood (7-9y), as well as age-related changes in children's application of these concepts—i.e., their attributions of different aspects of mental life to different target characters—which appear to be underway by early childhood and extend well into middle childhood and beyond. We have interpreted both kinds of differences as aspects of _conceptual development_ in this domain.

One major limitation of Studies 1-2, however, was that the task involved a rather advanced set of mental state vocabulary terms, including a variety of complex mental capacities (e.g., guilt, pride, awareness, depth perception) and using somewhat complicated syntax for some items (e.g., _sense whether something is close by or far away_, _figure out how to do things_). For 4- to 6-year-old children, in particular, some of the mental capacity items might have been outside of the range of the words they normally hear in discussions of mental states—let alone the words they normally use themselves. In addition, younger children may have found some aspects of the experimental paradigm distracting (e.g., being seated in front of the experimenter's laptop computer without being allowed to use it themselves) or difficult (e.g., using a three-point scale with minimal visual scaffolding; see SOM for an analysis of scale use across age groups).

Thus, in our final study, we focused on 4- to 6-year-old children, using a simpler set of mental capacities and a modified version of the experimental paradigm (validated among adults) with the aim of getting a clearer picture of conceptual structure and mental capacity attributions at this earlier point in development.

# Study 3

The primary goal of Study 3 was to provide a conceptual replication and extension of our findings in Study 2 that the conceptual structure underlying mental capacity attributions among preschool-age children is different from that of older children and adults, particularly in terms of the relationship between _BODY_ and _HEART_. In light of our concerns about vocabulary, attention, and use of the response scale among 4- to 6-year-old children in Study 2, we designed an even more child-friendly version specifically tailored to appropriate for young preschoolers, by streamlining the experimental protocol, providing more scaffolding for the response scale, and including only vocabulary items that were pre-tested to be familiar to young preschool children (see "Method"). 

A second goal of Study 3 was to assess younger children's attributions of mental life to what we have called "edge cases" in social reasoning: a beetle (an atypical animal) and a robot (an atypical object). In Studies 1 and 2, children of all ages appear to have attributed more social-emotional abilities (_HEART_) and fewer perceptual-cognitive abilities (_MIND_) to both of these edge cases, as compared to adults. In Study 2, 4- to 6-year-old children appear to have been particularly un-adult-like in their attributions to the beetle and the robot—but because participants were distributed across a wide range of target characters, we could not chart these differences with any precision. In contrast, in Study 1 the approach of focusing on "edge cases" in particular allowed us to estimate older children's aggregate attributions to these entities with precision, because large numbers of children assessed each of the two target characters. In Study 3, we returned to this "edge case" approach, limiting the target characters to a beetle and a robot.

## Method

### Participants

`r d3_ad %>% distinct(subid) %>% count() %>% as.numeric() + d3_46 %>% distinct(subid) %>% count() %>% as.numeric()` people participated in this study, including a group of adults and a group of 4- to 5-year-old children.

```{r}
# demographics
d3_ad_gender <- demo_fun(d3_ad, "gender", 2)
d3_ad_ethnicity <- demo_fun(d3_ad, "ethnicity_cat", 2)
```

Adults (_n_=`r d3_ad %>% distinct(subid) %>% count() %>% as.numeric()`) participated via MTurk in September 2018. Adult participants had gained approval for at least 95% of their previous work on MTurk; had MTurk accounts based in the US; and indicated that they were at least 18 years old. Adults were paid \$0.45 for approximately 2-4 minutes of their time (median duration: `r summary(d3_ad$duration)["Median"] %>% round(2)` min). An additional 21 adults participated but were excluded for failing to respond sensibly to an open-ended question about what they had been asked to do in the study (see Study 2 for examples; _n_=16) or for failing to pass one or more attention checks (e.g., "Please select no"; _n_=5). According to self report, the final adult sample ranged in age from `r summary(d3_ad$age)["Min."]`-`r summary(d3_ad$age)["Max."]` years (median: `r summary(d3_ad$age)["Median"]`y) and included slightly more men (`r round(d3_ad_gender$prop[d3_ad_gender$gender=="m"], 2) * 100`%) than women (`r round(d3_ad_gender$prop[d3_ad_gender$gender=="f"], 2) * 100`%). Adults predominantly identified as White (`r d3_ad_ethnicity$prop[d3_ad_ethnicity$ethnicity_cat=="white"] * 100`%; `r d3_ad_ethnicity$prop[d3_ad_ethnicity$ethnicity_cat=="black"] * 100`% identified as Black; `r d3_ad_ethnicity$prop[d3_ad_ethnicity$ethnicity_cat=="multi"] * 100`% identified as more than one race/ethnicity, and $\leq$ `r data.frame(d3_ad_ethnicity %>% filter(!ethnicity_cat %in% c("white", "multi")))$prop %>% max() * 100`% as any other race/ethnicity).

```{r}
# demographics
d3_46_gender <- demo_fun(d3_46, "gender", 2)
d3_46_ethnicity <- demo_fun(d3_46, "ethnicity", 2)
```

**XX CHECK WHEN SAMPLE IS COMPLETE**: Our planned sample size was 100 4- to 5-year-old children. Our final sample of children (_n_=`r d3_46 %>% distinct(subid) %>% count() %>% as.numeric()`) ranged in age from `r summary(d3_46$age)["Min."] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)`-`r summary(d3_46$age)["Max."] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)` years (median: `r summary(d3_46$age)["Median"] %>% round(2) %>% format(nsmall = 2)`y), and participated at a university-affiliated preschool in the Bay Area between January-XX 2018. We did not record study duration. According to school records, the sample of younger children included slightly more girls (`r d3_46_gender$prop[d3_46_gender$gender=="f"] * 100`%) than boys (`r d3_46_gender$prop[d3_46_gender$gender=="m"] * 100`%). Children were predominantly identified as White (`r d3_46_ethnicity$prop[d3_46_ethnicity$ethnicity=="white"] * 100`%) or multiracial (`r d3_46_ethnicity$prop[d3_46_ethnicity$ethnicity=="multi"] * 100`%; $\leq$ `r data.frame(d3_46_ethnicity %>% filter(!ethnicity %in% c("white", "multi", "MISSING")))$prop %>% max() * 100`% of children were identified as any other race/ethnicity, and `r d3_46_ethnicity$prop[d3_46_ethnicity$ethnicity=="MISSING"] * 100`% of children's parents declined to provide information on their race/ethnicity).

An additional XX children participated but were excluded for being outside the target age ranges.

### Materials and procedure 

Materials and procedure were adapted to be more appropriate for young preschoolers, with two primary goals in mind: Streamlining the experimental protocol to improve children's comprehension and attention to the task, and limiting mental capacities to words that are highly familiar to young preschool children.

In order to streamline the experimental protocol, we moved the task off of the computer (for children but not adults), instead using printed photographs of the target characters (measuring approximately 5 x 8 inches, printed in color and laminated) and recording children's responses by hand. At the time of testing, the experimenter and child sat side by side at a table, with the photograph placed on the table directly in front of the child for the duration of the task. 

We also streamlined the introduction to the task. The experimenter began by placing the photograph of the first target character in front of the child and asking, "Can you tell me what this is?" If a child provided an answer other than "beetle" or "robot," the experimenter said something to the effect of, "I'm going to call it a [beetle/robot]"; otherwise, the experimenter affirmed the child's correct response. The experimenter then said, "We're going to play a game about [beetles/robots]"; reminded children, "If you ever want to stop playing, you can just let me know and we'll go back to the classroom" (per this university preschool's protocol); and then launched directly into the first question (e.g., "Can beetles get sad?").

We scaffolded children's use of the three-point response scale by providing a physical representation of the scale, consisting of three large boxes, separated by blank space, containing the words "NO," "KINDA," and "YES" written in large font with all capital letters (to aid children with at least some reading skills in recognizing these words); color-coded according to the intensity of response (NO = very light blue, KINDA = medium blue, YES = dark blue); and ordered from left (NO) to right (YES). Each box measured approximately 2 x 4 inches; the boxes were laminated with slightly less than 1 inch of empty space between them (through which the table was visible). In addition to providing these visual and spatial cues to the fact that there were three response options—no, yes, and something conceptually and literally "in between" these extremes—we also added a line to the experimenter's script describing (and then reiterating) these response options on the first three trials ("You can say no [pointing to NO], kinda [pointing to KINDA], or yes [pointing to YES]"). The experimenter repeated these options on the first three trials for all children, and on any other trials where a child took more than a few seconds to answer or provided a response other than saying "yes," "kinda," or "no" or clearly pointing to one of these options on the response scale.

For each of the two target characters (beetle, robot), children answered 18 questions about its mental capacities. These items were chosen to be as short as possible and to be highly familiar to young preschool children. They were selected from a larger pilot study in which we asked 3- to 5-year-old children to complete stories that began with each of these mental capacities as a premise (e.g., "Let's imagine a person who _loves someone_. What happens next?"; "Now let's pretend that someone _remembers something_. What happens next?") and judged the appropriateness of their story completion. 

For the final set of questions, we aimed to select six clear examples of physiological sensations (_BODY_), social-emotional abilities (_HEART_), and perceptual-cognitive capacities (_MIND_), according to Studies 1-2 and Weisman et al.'s (2017) original studies with US adults. We reasoned that if these carefully selected examples of _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_ still elicited differences in correlational structures between 4- to 5-year-old children and adults, this would be particularly strong evidence of age-related changes in conceptual structure.

The final set of _BODY_ items included _feel hungry_, _get thirsty_, _feel sick_, _feel tired_, _get scared_, and _smell things_. _HEART_ items included _love someone_, _hate someone_, _feel happy_, _get sad_, _feel sorry_, and _get lonely_. _MIND_ items included _see_, _hear_, _think_, _remember things_, _know stuff_, and _figure things out_. We ensured that each category included a variety of phrasings (e.g., "_feel_ hungry" vs. "_get_ thirsty"; "remember _things_" vs. "know _stuff_") and valences when appropriate (e.g., happiness vs. sadness); when possible, we aimed to have these aspects of phrasing vary orthogonally with categories, such that "get" and "feel" appeared roughly equally often among the _BODY_ and _HEART_ items, and "things" appeared equally often among the _BODY_ and _MIND_ items. As in Studies 1-2, each mental capacity was associated with a short, preset definition, which was read to children if they expressed uncertainty about what a word meant or did not respond after prompting use of the response scale (see SOM).

Children first assessed all 18 mental capacities for one of the two target characters (e.g., the beetle), then completed an easy jigsaw puzzle featuring clothing and accessories appropriate for a rainy day (which took about 30-60 s to complete), and finally assessed all 18 mental capacities for the other target character (e.g., the robot).

This modified procedure—particularly moving the experiment off of the computer for children—required several changes to the experimental design. Rather than randomly assigning children to assess the beetle first or the robot first, the order of target characters was counterbalanced in advance. Likewise, rather than asking about the 18 mental capacities in a random order, questions about the first target character were asked in one of 8 pre-made random orders, and questions about the second target character were asked in the reverse order. The order of the target characters (beetle-robot or robot-beetle) and the order of the mental capacity questions (sequences 1-8) were fully crossed across participants. 

Adults participated in an online version of this same task, without a break between target characters. As in Studies 1-2, adults clicked through a website at their own pace, with one trial presented on each page and no ability to go backwards. 

### Data processing

We did not record response times or use this as a criterion for inclusion. As in Studies 1-2, we retained participants regardless of skipped trials (_n_=XX trials among children; XX% of all trials).

Following Weisman et al. (2017, Study 4), for our exploratory factor analyses we treated each participant's assessments of each target character as a separate set of observations (as if they came from different participants). This effectively doubled our sample size to `r nrow(d3_ad)` adults and `r nrow(d3_46)` children. (See SOM for separate EFAs of the participants' responses to the first target character that they were assigned to rate vs. the second character.)

## Results

### Conceptual structure: Adults

```{r}
# implement 3 factor retention protocols
nfact_par_d3_ad <- fa.parallel(d3_ad_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, 
                               fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$nfact
nfact_bic_d3_ad <- vss(d3_ad_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, rotate = chosen_rot, 
                       fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$vss.stats$BIC %>% which.min()
nfact_wdm_d3_ad <- reten_fun(d3_ad_wide_i, rot_type = chosen_rot)

cat("Parallel analysis: ", nfact_par_d3_ad,
    "\nMinimizing BIC: ", nfact_bic_d3_ad,
    "\nWeisman et al.: ", nfact_wdm_d3_ad)
```

```{r}
efa_4_d3_ad <- fa_fun(d3_ad_wide_i, 4)
```

All of our factor retention protocols suggested retaining three factors.

```{r}
efa_3_d3_ad <- fa_fun(d3_ad_wide_i, 3)
efa_3_plot_d3_ad <- heatmap_fun(efa_3_d3_ad, 
                                factor_names = c("BODY", "HEART", "MIND")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Adults"))
```

As expected, the conceptual structure revealed by this analysis among adults was characterized by a three-way distinction between _BODY_ (first factor, `r round(efa_3_d3_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution), _HEART_ (second factor, `r round(efa_3_d3_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of shared variance), and _MIND_ (third factor, `r round(efa_3_d3_ad$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of shared variance). See Figure 9, Panel C.

This suggests that our modified preschooler-friendly paradigm was valid: Using simpler vocabulary and a within-subjects approach to taget characters elicited the same intuitive ontology of mental life, among US adults, that was revealed in Studies 1-2 and in Weisman et al.'s (2017) previous work. 

### Conceptual structure: Children (4-5y)

```{r}
# implement 3 factor retention protocols
nfact_par_d3_46 <- fa.parallel(d3_46_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, 
                               fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$nfact
nfact_bic_d3_46 <- vss(d3_46_wide_i, cor = chosen_cor, rotate = chosen_rot, 
                       fm = chosen_fm, plot = F)$vss.stats$BIC %>% which.min()
nfact_wdm_d3_46 <- reten_fun(d3_46_wide_i, rot_type = chosen_rot)

cat("Parallel analysis: ", nfact_par_d3_46,
    "\nMinimizing BIC: ", nfact_bic_d3_46,
    "\nWeisman et al.: ", nfact_wdm_d3_46)
```

```{r}
efa_1_d3_46 <- fa_fun(d3_46_wide_i, 1)
```

As in Study 2, our three methods for determining how many factors to retain each suggested retaining different numbers of factors: In this case, Weisman et al.'s factor retention criteria suggested retaining `r nfact_wdm_d3_46` factors, parallel analysis suggested retaining `r nfact_par_d3_46` factors, and minimizing BIC suggested a null, `r nfact_bic_d3_46`-factor solution. Here we present both the four- and three-factor solutions. (See SOM for factor loadings on the one "factor" in the null, one-factor solution.)

#### Four-factor solution

```{r}
efa_4_d3_46 <- fa_fun(d3_46_wide_i, 4)

efa_4_plot_d3_46 <- heatmap_fun(efa_4_d3_46,
                                factor_names = c("MIND*", "BODY I", 
                                                 "BODY II", "HEART*")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Children (4-5y): 4-factor solution")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

```{r}
cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46 <- fa.congruence(efa_4_d3_46$loadings,
                                     efa_3_d3_ad$loadings)
```

In the rotated four-factor solution suggested by Weisman et al.'s retention criteria, the first factor corresponded primarily to perceptual-cognitive abilities, as well as some positive emotions. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _MIND_ factor (cosine similarity with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F1", "F3"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F1", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F1", "F1"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_4_d3_46, 4, "F1", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_4_d3_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated four-factor solution. 

The second factor corresponded primarily to physiological sensations, as well as one negative emotion (_get sad_). An analysis of factor congruence indicated that this factor was most similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F2", "F1"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F2", "F2"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F2", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_4_d3_46, 4, "F2", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_4_d3_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated four-factor solution. 

The third factor also corresponded to physiological sensations, as well as one perceptual ability (_see_). An analysis of factor congruence indicated that this factor was most similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F3", "F1"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F3", "F2"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F3", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_4_d3_46, 4, "F3", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_4_d3_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated four-factor solution. 

Finally, the fourth factor corresponded primarily to social-emotional abilities, with particularly strong loadings for negative emotions. An analysis of factor congruence indicated that this factor was most similar to adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F4", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F4", "F1"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_4_d3_ad_46["F4", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_4_d3_46, 4, "F4", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_4_d3_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F4"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated four-factor solution. (See Figure 9, Panel A, for all factor loadings.)

We would describe this conceptual structure as reminiscent of the _BODY_-_HEART_-_MIND_ structure found among older children and adults, but not as fully "adult-like." In particular, in this structure, the social-emotional abilities associated with the _HEART_ among older children and adults are not as clearly differentiated from either the physiological sensations of the _BODY_ or the perceptual-cognitive abilities of the _MIND_. Moreover—in a divergence from any of the previous studies—in this case the physiological sensations of the _BODY_ are split across two factors. 

#### Three-factor solution

```{r}
efa_3_d3_46 <- fa_fun(d3_46_wide_i, 3)

efa_3_plot_d3_46 <- heatmap_fun(efa_3_d3_46,
                                factor_names = c("BODY", "MIND*", "HEART*")) +
  labs(title = paste0("Children (4-5y): 3-factor solution")) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

```{r}
cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46 <- fa.congruence(efa_3_d3_46$loadings,
                                     efa_3_d3_ad$loadings)
```

In the rotated three-factor solution suggested by parallel analysis, the first corresponded primarily to physiological sensations. An analysis of factor congruence indicated that this factor was most similar to adults' _BODY_ factor (cosine similarity with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F1", "F1"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F1", "F2"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F1", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_46, 4, "F1", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d3_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F1"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. 

The second factor corresponded primarily to perceptual-cognitive abilities, as well as one positive emotion (_feel happy_). An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _MIND_ factor (cosine similarity with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F2", "F3"]`; with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F2", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F2", "F1"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_46, 4, "F2", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d3_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F2"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution.

The third factor corresponded primarily to social-emotional abilities. An analysis of factor congruence confirmed that this factor was most similar to adults' _HEART_ factor (cosine similarity with _HEART_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F3", "F2"]`; with _BODY_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F3", "F1"]`; with _MIND_: `r cong_efa_3_d3_ad_46["F3", "F3"]`). It was the dominant factor for such items as `r top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_46, 4, "F3", "pos")`, and accounted for `r round(efa_3_d3_46$Vaccounted["Proportion Explained", "F3"], 2) * 100`% of the shared variance in the rotated three-factor solution. (See Figure 9, Panel B, for all factor loadings.)

In relation to the _BODY_-_HEART_-_MIND_ structure found among older children and adults, we would describe this three-factor structure as being similar to the adult-like conceptual structure—with the notable exception that half of the social-emotional abilities (_get sad_, _hate someone_, and _feel happy_) did not load most strongly on children's ostenstive _HEART\*_ factor.

### Attributions of mental life

One of the goals of Study 3 was to take a closer look at young children's attributions to the two social "edge cases" that were the focus of Study 1 with older children. How do 4- to 5-year-old children's attributions of capacities related to _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_ to an atypical animal (a beetle) and an atypical inanimate object (a robot) vary across early childhood (4-5y), and how do they compare to the mental capacity attributions of adults?

#### Children vs. adults

```{r}
d3_all_wide_i <- d3_ad_wide_i %>%
  rownames_to_column("subid_char") %>%
  full_join(d3_46_wide_i %>%
              rownames_to_column("subid_char")) %>%
  column_to_rownames("subid_char")
```

```{r}
efa_3_d3_46_project_scores <- predict(object = efa_3_d3_ad,
                                      data = d3_46_wide_i,
                                      old.data = d3_ad_wide_i) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("subid_char") %>%
  mutate(subid = gsub("_.*$", "", subid_char),
         character = gsub("^.*_", "", subid_char)) %>%
  gather(factor, score, -c(subid, character, subid_char)) %>%
  mutate(factor_name = recode_factor(factor,
                                     "F1" = "BODY",
                                     "F2" = "HEART",
                                     "F3" = "MIND")) %>%
  arrange(subid_char)
```

As in Studies 1-2, we we projected children's responses into the factor space defined by adults (standardized in terms of adults' responses), and examined factor scores by age group (using the method articulated by ten Berge et al., 1999). This yielded three scores for each participant, corresponding, in principle, to holistic judgments of the social-emotional, physiological, and perceptual-cognitive abilities of the target character the participant evaluated. (Note that each of these three scores takes into account factor loadings for all 18 mental capacities, as shown in Figure 9.) 

This allowed us to examine the effects of age group (adult, child), character (beetle, robot), and factor (_BODY_, _HEART_, _MIND_) on these scores via mixed effects Bayesian regression. See Table 5 for the results of a maximal model and Figure 12 for scores by age group, age (for children), factor, and character.

The results for adults were identical to Study 1: Collapsing across factors, factor scores suggest that adults generally attributed fewer mental capacities to the robot than the beetle (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "characterR_GM")`). However, this appears to be entirely due to the huge discrepancy between characters in the _BODY_ domain; the difference between characters was reduced to nearly nothing in the _HEART_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "factor_nameH_GM:characterR_GM")`), and reversed in the perceptual-cognitive domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "factor_nameM_GM:characterR_GM")`). 

Likewise, the pattern of 4- to 5-year-old children's responses strongly resembled that of 7- to 9-year-old children's responses in Study 1: Children tended to attribute more mental capacities, collapsing across characters, than did adults (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "age_groupCH46_AD")`) - but this was driven primarily by the social-emotional domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "factor_nameH_GM:age_groupCH46_AD")`), and was reversed in the perceptual-cognitive domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "factor_nameM_GM:age_groupCH46_AD")`). 

In addition to these findings, however, we also observed that, as a group, 4- to 5-year-old children perceived less of a difference between the robot and the beetle than did adults (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "age_groupCH46_AD:characterR_GM")`), partiuclarly in the _MIND_ domain (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_all, "factor_nameM_GM:age_groupCH46_AD:characterR_GM")`).

A visual inspection of Figure 10 clarifies these findings. Both 4- to 5-year-old children and adults marked a clear difference between the robot and the beetle in the physiological sensations of the _BODY_ (top row), in line with the animate–inanimate distinction—but children, as a group, under-attributed _BODY_ capacities to the atypical animal (the beetle) and over-attributed _BODY_ capacities to the atypical inanimate object (the robot). This pattern aligns with findings in both Study 1 (with older children) and Study 2 (with both age groups of children, but particularly 4- to 5-year-old children).

Meanwhile, both 4- to 5-year-old children and adults credited the robot with slightly greater perceptual-cognitive skills (_MIND_) than the beetle (bottom row)—but children perceived this difference to be smaller and generally under-attributed _MIND_ capacities to both target characters. 

Finally, in the _HEART_ domain (middle row) both the beetle and the robot received rather low scores among adults, but very high scores among children.

See Figure 11 for raw counts of _no_, _kinda_, and _yes_ responses for all items, grouped by factor, character, and age group, and see SOM for an analysis, parallel to the regression analyses here, of the proportion of the top-loading mental capacities for each factor that were endorsed by participants of different ages.

To explore age-related differences continuously within the child sample, we conducted an additional regression analysis on children's factor scores alone, including interactions with exact age in years (centered at the mean: `r format(round(mean(d3_ch_age$age, na.rm = T), 2), nsmall = 2)`y) rather than age group. In line with the age group analysis described in the previous section, this confirmed that, relative to the grand mean, attributions of _HEART_ decreased with age (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_46, "factor_nameH_GM:age")`) and attributions of _MIND_ increased with age (`r write_b_95CI_fun(efa_3_scores_r_d3_46, "factor_nameM_GM:age")`). (See Table 6 for the full results of this model.)

**BOOKMARK, RETURN WHEN SAMPLE IS COMPLETE:** We observed no substantial age effects within the child sample. However, visual inspection of Figure 12 suggests that, with age, children distinguished more sharply between the beetle and the robot in the _BODY_ domain (left). Because a comparison between _BODY_ and the grand mean was not included in our coding scheme for factor, and because this particular effect takes the form of increasing attributions to the beetle and decreasing attributions to the robot, our analysis may not have picked this up. To investigate this further, we re-ran the analysis swapping a comparison between _BODY_ and the grand mean in for the comparison between _HEART_ and the grand mean, but this still yielded no substantial age effects (see SOM).

## Discussion

We had two goals in Study 3: (1) To test whether the differences in conceptual structure between 4- to 6-year-old children and older children adults, as revealed by Study 2, would emerge in a study carefully tailored to be age-appropriate for young preschool children; and (2) To explore young children's attributions to the social "edge cases" that were the focus of Study 1 with older children and adults, and which seemed to elicit particularly un-adult-like responses from the small subset of children who assessed these characters in Study 2.

### The _BODY_-_HEART_-_MIND_ framework is nascent, but not robust, among preschool-age children

Regarding our first goal, Study 3 provides further evidence that the conceptual structure underlying mental capacity attributions undergoes substantial changes between early and middle childhood. Using a paradigm that was better tailored for this age group and that featured vocabulary items expressly designed to pick out (adult) notions of _BODY_, _HEART_, and _MIND_ in a balanced way (6 items per factor), Study 3 did provide some indications that this conceptual structure may be more mature in the early preschool years than Study 2 would suggest. However, even in this modified paradigm, we observed several indications that this three-part conceptual structure is not fully in place by 4-5y.

efa_3_d3_46_modload <- loadings_fun(efa_3_d3_46, "long") %>% 
  filter(loading >= 0.30) %>%
  arrange(factor, desc(loading)) %>%
  group_by(capacity) %>%
  mutate(adult_factor = case_when(
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F1", "pos")) == T ~ "BODY",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F2", "pos")) == T ~ "HEART",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F3", "pos")) == T ~ "MIND",
    TRUE ~ "no dominant factor")) %>%
  ungroup()
```

First, the similarities. As with the 4- to 6-year-old children Study 2, 4- to 5-year-old children’s responses in Study 3 were characterized by strong correlations among a suite of perceptual and (particularly) cognitive capacities that we have labeled _MIND_. This suite of _MIND_ abilities was robust to analysis choices and emerged clearly in both Studies 2 and 3, bolstering our earlier claim that this is one aspect of conceptual structure that may be relatively stable from early in childhood. 

More broadly, in the three-factor solution suggested by parallel analysis (Figure 9, Panel B), we see recognizable _BODY_ and _MIND_ factors as well as a nascent _HEART\*_ factor, on which most of the social-emotional items loaded moderately strongly (loadings $\geq$ 0.30: `r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_3_d3_46_modload$capacity[efa_3_d3_46_modload$adult_factor == "HEART" & efa_3_d3_46_modload$factor == "F3"])`). This is a substantially more adult-like conceptual structure than we observed among 4- to 6-year-old children in Study 2.

```{r}
efa_3_d3_46_lowload <- loadings_fun(efa_3_d3_46, "long") %>% 
  filter(loading < 0.30) %>%
  arrange(factor, desc(loading)) %>%
  group_by(capacity) %>%
  mutate(adult_factor = case_when(
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F1", "pos")) == T ~ "BODY",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F2", "pos")) == T ~ "HEART",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F3", "pos")) == T ~ "MIND",
    TRUE ~ "no dominant factor")) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
efa_3_d3_46_domCap <- loadings_fun(efa_3_d3_46, "long") %>% 
  arrange(desc(loading)) %>%
  group_by(capacity) %>%
  top_n(1, loading) %>%
  mutate(adult_factor = case_when(
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F1", "pos")) == T ~ "BODY",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F2", "pos")) == T ~ "HEART",
    grepl(capacity, top_n_domCap(efa_3_d3_ad, 18, "F3", "pos")) == T ~ "MIND",
    TRUE ~ "no dominant factor")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(factor, desc(loading))
```

However, as in Study 2, the very fact that different approaches to factor retention yielded different results is further evidence that, although we observed some evidence for a nascent _BODY_-_HEART_-_MIND_ framework among 4- to 6-year-old children, this framework was not robust among preschool-age children. 

This appears to be particularly true with regard to their understanding of social-emotional abilities (_HEART_). Echoing the results of Study 2, children’s responses suggest that they may not consider the social-emotional abilities that constitute what we have called _HEART_ among adults to hang together as one, clearly distinct component of mental life. Even in the more adult-like, three-factor solution (Figure 9, Panel B), two of the six social-emotional items did _not_ loading strongly on the ostensive _HEART\*_ factor (loadings $\leq$ 0.30: `r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_3_d3_46_lowload$capacity[efa_3_d3_46_lowload$adult_factor == "HEART" & efa_3_d3_46_lowload$factor == "F3"])`); and four of the six social-emotional items loaded moderately strongly on the _MIND_ factor (loadings $\geq$ 0.30: `r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_3_d3_46_modload$capacity[efa_3_d3_46_modload$adult_factor == "HEART" & efa_3_d3_46_modload$factor == "F2"])`). Indeed, _MIND_ was the _dominant_ factor for two social-emotional items in this three-factor solution (`r ital_by_cap_fun(efa_3_d3_46_domCap$capacity[efa_3_d3_46_domCap$factor == "F2" & efa_3_d3_46_domCap$adult_factor == "HEART"])`). None of these observations were true among adults (Figure 9, Panel C).

### Like older children, preschool-age children over-attribute _HEART_ and under-attriute _MIND_ to social "edge cases"

Regarding our second goal, Study 3 revealed similar pattern of age-related changes in children’s mental capacity attributions to the previous studies.

In the _BODY_ domain, a distinction between animate and inanimate target characters was present even among the youngest children in the sample, but appeared (upon visual inspection of Figure 12) to increase across the 4-5y age range, never quite reaching the degree of separation present among adults (note also that no within-sample age effects were born out by our regression analyses; Table 6). This echoes the general results of Study 2—as well as the specific observation that 4- to 6-year-old children's _BODY_ attributions diverged from adults primarily in their assessments of the robot and the beetle. (As we discussed earlier, similar, subtler patterns were present even among 7- to 9-year-old children in Study 1.) These three studies taken together bolster our claim that, while by the preschool years children are relatively far along in their mastery of which entities in the world are subject to the physiological sensations of the BODY, they continue to refine their application of this concept throughout early childhood (and perhaps beyond).

In the _HEART_ domain, we again see developmental trends consistent with the previous studies. As with both older and especially younger children in Studies 1-2, in Study 3 4- to 5-year-old children attributed much more in the way of social-emotional abilities to both a beetle and a robot than did adults. As in Study 2, we observed no evidence for this tendency to decline with age within this sample.

Finally, in the _MIND_ domain, 4- to 5-year-old children attributed much less in the way of perceptual-cognitive abilities to both a beetle and a robot than did adults, ehcoing previous findings among 4- to 9-year-old children in Studies 1-2. Visual inspection of Figure 12 suggests that these under-attributions may have become less dramatic with age within the child sample, particularly for the beetle (but again, our regression analyes did not reveal substantial age effects). Beyond this, children  were less likely than adults to mark a sharp distinction beteen "animates" (in this case, the beetle) and "inanimates" (the robot) in the _MIND_ domain, which echoes the surprising finding in Study 2 that even older children (7-9y) failed to make adult-like distinctions between animate and inanimte target characters in their attributions of _MIND_.

# General Discussion

## Summary

In three large-scale studies (total _N_=`r nrow(d1_79_wide) + nrow(d2_79_wide) + nrow(d2_46_wide) + nrow(d3_46_wide)/2` children and `r nrow(d1_ad_wide) + nrow(d2_ad_wide) + nrow(d3_ad_wide)/2` adults), we set out to expore the development of US children's conceptual representations of mental life between 4-9y of age. These studies suggest that these representations undergo substantial development over the course of early and middle childhood—in two distinct senses. 

First, analyses of the correlational structure of children's mental capacity attributions (via exploratory factor analysis) suggested changes in ontological _structure_. Between early childhood (4-6 years; Studies 2-3) and middle childhood (7-9 years; Studies 1-2), children's sense of which mental capacities "go together" seems to unfold into a higher-dimensional space, characterized by stronger differentiation of the social-emotional abilities that we've called _HEART_ from the physiological sensations of the _BODY_ and the perceptual-cognitive abilities of the _MIND_. 

Second, analyses of factor scores—summaries of which mental capacities participants tended to attribute to which target characters—revealed a second kind of age-related difference: what we might call changes in the _application_ of concepts of mental life. In some ways, these differences were clearest from the perspective of distinguishing between animate beings and inanimate objects: In the _BODY_ domain, an animate-inanimate distinction was clearly present even among the youngest children in these studies, but it became more dramatic with age—apparently driven by refinements in children's understanding of atypical animates, such as insects, and atypical inanimates, such as robots (what we have called "edge cases" in social reasoning). In both the _MIND_ and the _HEART_ domains, however, we also observed global differences in children's mental capacity attributions, with children under-attributing _MIND_ and over-attributing _HEART_ (relative to adults) across the range of target characters included in these studies.
